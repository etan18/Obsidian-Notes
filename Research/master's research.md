### UGBA 192T Final Project Ideas

1. Supply chains of specialty foods stores
	1. Market Hall Foods
	2. "Microeconomies"
2. Food in hospitals
3. Food waste in restaurants
	1. Anticipating demand
4. What happens when governments invest in food supply chains?
	1. From class: the "new" and "disruptive" methods in agriculture are typically piloted by small to medium sized farms. A lot of the time, these methods are costly to implement, due to long transition periods or from opportunity costs. The chance of success of these methods can be significantly increased when governments support these transitions (through subsidies or other policy-based levers).
	2. The example Prof. York gave was about Tree-Range Farm in Minnesota, which is piloting a hazelnut x chicken operation. Hypothetically, the local Minnesota government could invest in this new technology by buying half the supply of hazelnuts from Tree-Range.
	3. My idea for this project:
		1. Research CA agriculture policy (or even county/local policy) that supports innovation. 
		2. Research beneficiaries of this policy and their effects from before and after the policy goes into effect
		3. Case studies based
5. Impacts of non-food policy on food supply chains
	1. Look for relationships between major policy decisions and food prices, etc. Policy can be categorized into key areas which may impact food: immigration, international (tariffs), climate policy

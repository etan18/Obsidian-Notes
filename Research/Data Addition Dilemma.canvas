Thus, the change in fairness metrics correlates with the KL divergence between the combined dataset and the *augmented* max-entropy distribution which satisfies specified fairness constraints.\n- Observations to motivate this claim:\n\t1. Scaling from the test hospital only (e.g. training on 1000 samples vs. 2000 samples) consistently improves performance among most hospitals, much not by much.\n\t2. In comparison, when we train a model on 1000 samples of test hospital $\\cup$ 1000 samples of another hospital, the resulting performance difference varies a lot, but generally we'll find a hospital that improves performance by *more* than if we just doubled the amount of training data from the test hospital only.\n- Open questions\n\t1. Are performance changes commutative/symmetric? i.e. is it generally true that if adding hospital X to hospital Y improves hospital Y's test accuracy, then adding Y to X will improve X's test accuracy?\n\t2. What information theory-based heuristics exist/have we already tested?\n\t3. Does the distribution of the added data still need to be similar to the test hospital?\n\n","x":800,"y":-610,"width":700,"height":730},

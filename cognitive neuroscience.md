Cognitive neuroscience is the study of "how the brain enables thought". 
- Cognition: the process of "knowing", encompassing [[perception]], reasoning, [[consciousness]]
- Neuroscience: the organization and function of the nervous system

This field uses empirical scientific methods applied to the brain to inquire about the intangible mind. This setup takes a [[theory of mind#monism|physicalist]] view on the theory of mind.

**Cytoarchitectonics** looks at the structural organization of cells by examining stained tissue under a microscope to identify different layers and cell types. This method was employed to distinguish the **Brodmann areas** (early 20th century), a mapping of the brain into 52 distinct regions based on the density, arrangement, and types of [[neurons]] present in that region.
- Provided a standardized reference system for the cerebral cortex
- Areas can be linked to [[cognitive architectures#localization|localized]] functions, including BA 17 (primary [[visual cortex]]) and BA 4 (primary motor cortex)

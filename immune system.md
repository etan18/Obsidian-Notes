### innate immune system
The **innate immune system** is the body's first line of defense against pathogens and harmful invaders. It is non-specific, meaning it targets a wide range of pathogens without requiring prior exposure.

Some key components of the innate immune system include
1. **Skin & mucous membranes**: acts as a physical barrier which prevents the entry of pathogens
2. **Phagocytes**: e.g. macrophages and neutrophils, which engulf and destroy pathogens
3. **Inflammatory response**: triggered when tissues are damaged or infected, leading to redness, heat, swelling, and pain. This recruits immune cells to the site of infection or injury.


>[!info] The Immune Response
>When the immune system detects a pathogen, it initiates an immune response, which is a coordinated effort to eliminate the threat. This response begins with the innate immune system's rapid actions, and if the pathogen persists, the **adaptive immune system** is activated to provide a more targeted and long-lasting defense.

**Cytokines** act as messengers for the immune system. They are secreted by various immune cells and help coordinate the body's defense by promoting inflammation, recruiting immune cells to infection sites, and regulating the activity of immune cells.
### sleep and immune function
Certain cytokines, like **TNF-alpha**, are involving in promoting [[sleep]].

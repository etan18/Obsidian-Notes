## graph traversal
Graphs are commonly used to model [[search problems]], wherein we are trying to find some optimal path from some source node $A$ to another node.
#### djikstra's algorithm
Shortest paths from vertex $A$ to all others on a graph. $O((|V| + |E|)\log |V|)$ runtime.
1. Set the distance of your start node to 0, and all other nodes to +INF. The start node is selected as the current node.
2. For all nodes adjacent to your current node, add each to a min-priority [[queue]] based on the distance of the current node to the start node + the distance from the node to the current node.
3. Pop the node with the minimum distance from the queue and set it to current node.

Djikstraâ€™s assumes that all edge weights are positive, and therefore a path from node $a$ to $b$ should never pass through a node that is farther away from $a$ than $b$. With negative edges this is not always the case.  **Bellman-Ford** takes this case into account.

#### bellman-ford algorithm
Shortest paths from vertex $A$ to all others on a graph, taking into account the possibility of negatively-weighted edges.

1. Set the distance of your start node to 0, and all other nodes to +INF. The start node is selected as the current node.
2. Iterate through all vertices $v \in V$. For each $v$, update the weight as

$$ dist(v) = \min(dist(v), \min(dist(k) + e_{v, k} \text{ for } k \text{ adjacent to } v)) $$

3. Since the shortest path between any 2 vertices on a graph has at most |V| - 1 edges, we will perform step (2) |V| - 1 times. We will have a check to terminate early if no updates are made in an iteration
4. If any distances are updated on the final repetition, then there must be a negative cycle created. Run one more iteration of updates.
#### A* search
Shortest path from vertex _A_ to _B_ on a graph.
1. Set the distance of your start node to 0, and all other nodes to +INF. The start node is selected as the current node.
2. For all nodes adjacent to your current node, add each to a min-priority queue based on the total distance of the shortest path found so far + the estimated remaining cost of going to that node (decided by some heuristic).
3. Pop the node with the minimum value from the queue and set it to current node.

# hypergraphs

**Hypergraphs** are a generalization of the basic graph structure, wherein an *edge* can join together any number of vertices. In standard graphs, an edge connects exactly two vertices.

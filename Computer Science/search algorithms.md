For all of these search problems, we will consider 
- The *branching factor*, $b$, defined as the number of child nodes opened up for exploration at each fringe node
- The max depth, $m$, or how many layers we're exploring
- The depth of the shallowest solution, $s$

The code implementations for all of the search algorithms described on this page follow the same basic structure.
```
def graphSearch(problem, fringe):
	visited = Set()
	fringe.add(problem.initialState)
	while not fringe.isEmpty():
		node = fringe.pop()
		if node not in visited:
			if problem.isGoal(node):
				return node
			for child in node.getChildren():
				fringe.add(child)
	return "No Solution"
	
```
The key difference is the data structure used to store values on the fringe, which decides the order in which nodes are searched.

## depth-first search
**Depth-first search (DFS)** always selects the deepest node to expand first. It is important that DFS be used with a set maximum depth, so that it does not get stuck traversing an infinite tree.

> [!info] DFS has $O(b^m)$ time complexity and $O(bm)$ space complexity.
##### implementation
Implementation of DFS typically involves a last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack as the fringe.

## breadth-first search
**Breadth-first search (BFS)** always selects the shallowest node to expand first. BFS is generally not optimal, because it expands every child node at every depth, making it inefficient. The upside of BFS is that it is guaranteed to find the shortest path, if it does find one.

>[!info] BFS has $O(b^s)$ time complexity and $O(b^s)$ space complexity
##### implementation
Implementation of BFS uses a first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue as the fringe.

## uniform cost search
**Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** is in the class of [[greedy algorithms]], meaning it always chooses the *lowest-cost* node on the fringe to explore. UCS is both complete and optimal if we assume all costs are non-negative. 

Let $C^*$ be the cost of the optimal path, and $\epsilon$ be the min cost between any two nodes in the state space graph.
>[!info] UCS has $O(b^{C^*/\epsilon})$ time complexity and $O(b^{C^*/\epsilon})$ space complexity

*Note:* this is [[graph theory|Djikstra's Algorithm]], except UCS terminates when a goal state is reached, whereas Djikstra's checks all possibilities for the shortest path between two states.

*Note:* [[graph theory|A* search]] is an extension of UCS that uses [[heuristics]] to decide which node to explore next.
##### implementation
Implementation of UCS uses a heap-based priority queue.

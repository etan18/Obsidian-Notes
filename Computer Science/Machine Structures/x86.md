x86 is an **assembly language** which is commonly seen in modern computers.

>[!info] Little Endian
x86 is a *little-endian* system. This means that when storing a word in memory, the least significant byte is stored at the lowest address, and the most significant byte is stored at the highest address.
## registers
In addition to the existing [[memory structure]], there are also *registers*, which store memory directly on the CPU. Registers don't have traditional memory addresses, and are just referred to by name. There are three special x86 registers:
- _eip_ is the _instruction pointer_, and it stores the address of the machine instruction currently being executed. 
- _ebp_ is the _base pointer_, and it stores the address of the top of the current stack frame. 
- _esp_ is the _stack pointer_, and it stores the address of the bottom of the current stack frame. 

## calling convention
The **prologue** is a series of operations performed before a function call.
1. Save caller-saved register values onto the stack *if they're needed after the function returns*
2. Push callee parameters onto the stack in reverse order

Before the function returns, include a function **epilogue** to restore necessary values that the caller needs.

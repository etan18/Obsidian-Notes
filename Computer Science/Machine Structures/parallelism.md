Parallelism is a core topic in machine structures. It is a principle of efficiency, where our goal as computer engineers is to execute as many instructions as possible at the same time. 

This is generally done by executing non-interfering *instruction sets* on different [[threads]] at the same time.

>[!tip] Amdahl's Law
>The amount of instructions we can run in parallel is limitedâ€”some processes must be executed sequentially. This essentially bounds how efficient parallelizing can make our programs.

In general, our runtime is composed of three factors:
1. The number of instructions in the program
2. The number of cycles per instruction
3. The time of each cycle -> cannot be sped up, the absolute limit is the speed of light

A database **transaction** is the base unit of work when interacting with the database. Depending on your use case, a single transaction may encompass multiple queries or operations with the database.

A well designed database will capture the four properties of the **ACID** acronym in all transactions:
- **Atomicity**: a transaction is either completed fully or not at all. A transaction may not leave the system in a state of data loss or corruption.
- **Consistency**: transactions only make changes to tables in predefined, predictable ways.
- **Isolation**: when multiple users are reading and writing from the same table all at once, isolation of their transactions ensures that the concurrent transactions don't interfere with or affect one another.
- **Durability**: changes to your data made by successfully executed transactions will be saved, even in the event of system failure.

## scaling
SQL databases (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL) are also known as relational databases. They are efficient with handling many tables of structured data, which are each defined by a schema. However, the primary drawback is that SQL databases are difficult to scale horizontally due to their relational nature. **Horizontal scaling** in [[distributed systems]] involves adding more servers in order to share the load more manageably across resources.

**NoSQL** (e.g. MongoDB, DynamoDB) was introduced to address the horizontal scaling problems of traditional SQL. It 
- Does not support table relationships, and data is usually stored in documents or as key-value pairs. This makes them more flexible and easy to set up.
- Typically designed for write-heavy and/or distributed systems
- Does not guarantee strong consistency, rather only eventual consistency. This means that updates to replicas of the data may take longer, resulting in potentially stale reads.

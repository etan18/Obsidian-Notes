Behaviorism arose in the field of psychology as an objective way to study the mind. It was brought about by John B. Watson in 1913 in his paper "*Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It*", calling for a focus on **observable behavior**. Prior to this work, the [[theory of mind]] took more philosophical approaches which could not be definitively proved or disproved.

##### associationism
**Associationism** is the philosophical predecessor to behaviorism, and is the doctrine which behaviorism is built upon. It views mental processes as built upon one another through experience. Psychological associationists believe that the aggregate of a person's experience determines the course of their mental development.

This was at one point the dominating view, but overlooks the innate complexity built into the human organism---a position articulated by people like Kant, Darwin, and Descartes.

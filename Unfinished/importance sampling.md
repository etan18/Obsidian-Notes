Importance sampling is a *Monte Carlo* method for evaluating the properties of a [[random variable]] and its probability distribution (e.g. its expected value).

>Monte Carlo statistical methods are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on *repeated random sampling* to simulate probabilistic scenarios in a way that captures uncertainty.

#### genre





#### charles ives
One of the first American composers (1874 - 1954) to receive recognition on global scale.

***Piano Sonata No. 2, Concord, MA, 1840-1860***
- He is trying to evoke a specific time and place (Concord, MA between 1840 and 1860)
	- Should feel nostalgic, even though Ives wasn't alive at that time
	- Piece was written between 1905-1920 (WWI, Progressivism, Temperence)
- Each of the 4 movements in the sonata is named after a prolific literary figure with ties to Concord, MA at that time period
	- Emerson, Hawthorne, Alcott, Thoreau
- "Quotes" Beethoven through the Alcotts
	- there is an aspect of blending European tradition (which has dominated classical music) with American simplistic life.


#### the great migration
###### strange fruit (1939)
Poem/song from the era of [[migration in america]] about lynchings in the south
- The central analogy of "strange fruit" refers to the commonness of lynchings (hanging African Americans from trees) as a sight in the American South
	- The analogy does make it known that lynchings are a product of a culture that was intentionally cultivated in the South
- The song is eerie and serious in nature

###### william grant still (1895 - 1978)
Classical composer that came about as part of the Harlem Renaissance. He was the the first African-American to conduct a major American symphony orchestra. 
- Known for his *Afro-American Symphony* (1930)

***And they lynched him on a tree (1942)***
Historical context: during the great migration, there had recently been an anti-lynching bill which was passed by the House of Representatives but failed in the Senate.

The piece is a response to a lynching
- intense, ends with dissonance, lacks resolution, to mean that this is an ongoing problem

#### civil rights movement
"Little Fruit Stand Riot"
- April 1964 in Harlem: a group of black kids knocked over a fruit stand and were beaten by police
	- Two bystanding black men intervened to help and were also beaten
The Harlem 6
- A little over a week later, two people were stabbed in a used clothing store, one died. Four individuals who were identified at the scene of the fruit stand riot---all teenagers--- along with two other black men, were arrested and put on trial for the stabbings. They became known as the Harlem Six
- In March 1965, the Harlem Six were found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.
- In 1971, four of the six were tried again and, after a deadlocked jury, the judge declared a mistrial. Ultimately, all but one of the men---Robert Rice, who remains convicted to this day---were found not guilty and released.

>[!note] James Baldwin, "A Report from Occupied Territory" (1966)
>"And the police are simply the hired enemies of this population. They are present to keep the Negro in his place and to protect white business interests, and they have no other function."
>
>"These things happen, in all our Harlems, every single day. If we ignore this fact, and our common responsibility to change this fact, we are sealing our doom."
>- There is a call to action here, where we have to consider *why* Baldwin titled the essay what he did, and who he is specifically addressing. 

###### steve reich (1936-)
One of the most important living composers, leading figure in contemporary-classical music, particularly *minimalism*. Minimalism was an avant-garde musical movement originating in the mid-20th century.
- **Minimalism:** A subgenre of experimental classical music that emerged in the 1960s and 70s, featuring intentionally simplified melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic materials, usually through a high degree of repetition.
- He also produced *tape music*, which manipulates magnetic tape recordings to compose other pieces
- *Phasing* is another technique Reich employed, where the primary compositional process uses multiple tracks playing the same part (a repetitive phrase) in steady but non-identical tempi.
	- The two tracks gradually shift out of unison, creating a complex echo or ringing effect, until the tracks sync back up periodically

*Come Out* (1966)
One of the key tape pieces of music in minimalism and civil rights
- Uses phasing track structure to send a message
- Repeats a voice recording of Daniel Hamm, one of the Harlem Six, describing an injury he received after being beaten by the police.
> "I had to, like, open the bruise up, and let some of the bruise blood come out to show them"

*Come Out* is a technological masterpiece, but its role as a political piece has drawn differing perspectives.
- Some have argued that the distortion of Hamm's voice has disfigured the meaning of the message and "merged the oppressed with the oppressor"
- Others argue that the avant-gardeness of the piece has kept the Harlem Six in the minds of the audience for decades just by virtue of being a musical masterpiece--- "good art preserves the stuff it's about"
The meaning of a work of art isn't fixed, it evolves over time.

###### solange
Solange's *A Seat at the Table* (2016) is one of the most critically acclaimed albums of its decade. It is a contemporary R&B album that incorporates elements of funk, neo-soul, and synth.

Much of the album's content is a commentary on the modern-day African American experience. 
- The album's opening song "Rise" was inspired by police killings in Ferguson and Baltimore, which led to nationwide protests.
- Song "F.U.B.U." (For Us By Us) is a nod to a 90s African American hip hop apparel brand and "Don't Touch My Hair" comments on a universal experience for African American women
- In one of the interludes, Solange's father and former manager speaks about his childhood filled with integration, segregation and racism, which left him "angry for years"

"Cranes in the Sky" analysis:
- repetition of "away" - I tried to ___ it away
- Solange has a very kind, sweet, tender voice

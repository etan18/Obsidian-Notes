**What happens during the boot process of a Linux system, between power on and the time you get a login prompt?**

1. Firmware (BIOS) initializes the hardware of the system (e.g. keyboard, display, storage controllers) and performs the POST (power on self test) to check hardware integrity. It then executes the boot loader. 
2. Boot loader (in Linux, usually LILO) starts the Linux [[operating system#the os kernel|kernel]]
	- Boot loader is a specialized type of software specifically for starting the boot process and loading the OS from memory
3. The kernel process is responsible for initializing the root filesystem, drivers, and starting the `init` process. Technically, the kernel spawns the idle process (PID 0) which spawns `init`.
	- The `init` process is always the first user process started in a Linux/Unix-based system. It's spawned directly by the kernel, is a daemon (background process), and remains running until the system is shut down.
4. The `init` process (PID 1) is the actual software responsible for showing the login prompt and initializing the user-facing software components of the system.
	- Runs startup scripts, mounts additional filesystems, starts background daemons, and prepares user sessions

**What happens internally when you type a command into the shell?**

1. At its core, the shell is a computer program that serves as a command line interpreter. It is a running process that spawns a child process to execute each command a user gives it. The general format for an input command is
``` 
[PROGRAM/CMD] [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]
- essential linux system binaries like ls, cp, mv, etc. are stored in /bin/
- non-essential system binaries like vim, wget, git are stored in /usr/bin/
- directories stored in the $PATH env variable are where the OS searches for executables
```
1. Given these components, the shell spawns a child process, which will use the `exec` system call, or a variant of it, to execute `PROGRAM` given the `ARGUMENTS` passed in.
2. The process will be able to find the executable for the command because essential commands are stored in the /bin/ directory by default in Linux, that's why they're always available. By default as well, the /bin/ directory is also stored within the $PATH environment variable, which is used to specify which paths to look for executable files in.

## troubleshooting

**Framework**:
1. Ask clarifying questions about the system set-up, if any.
2. Quickly brainstorm a few points where the issue may be arising from. **Try to reproduce the problem.**
3. For the main points, explain how to go about checking whether that is the problem. First want to isolate what layer of the system the error is occurring at (network, application, memory)
	- Is the server/process running? -> use `ps aux | grep` to check
	- Is memory full? -> use `df`, `du`, `free`, `top`
	- These are ways to get a high level overview of the system and see if anything glaring sticks out
4. To get more information on the problem, go into the logs.
	- Stored in `/var/log/`, with separate logs for authentication, sudo, etc.
		- `/var/log/syslog` is the standard logging facility (need sudo)
	- The `dmesg` command prints kernel-specific log messages (most useful for boot troubleshooting)
	- Check `/proc/interrupts` for information on interrupts

**Commands to check system performance**:
- `top`: displays a system summary (uptime, # running tasks/processes, active users, load averages), CPU usage, memory usage (RAM, cache, swap memory)
	- `htop` is a newer command that prints the same info in prettier display that allows for cursor movement
- `ls -l`: lists the permissions, # of hard links, owning user, owning user group, size, and modification timestamp of all files/directories in the CWD
- `df -h`: displays disk usage of the entire filesystem, where each line in the output is a partition of the system
- `du -h`: displays disk usage of files and directories
	- `-d 1` option limits the depth of search (default will print *all* recursive subdir sizes)
	- `du -sh [DIRECTORY]`  will summarize the DIRECTORY size only
- `free -h`: displays RAM/swap memory usage of the whole system 
- `ps aux`: displays the process status of all users, including background/daemon processes
	- Commonly used with 
		- `--sort=-%mem` to sort by memory usage
		- `| head -n [NUM]` to limit output
		- `| grep [STRING/PATTERN]` to find entries that match
- `vmstat`: high-level summary of system CPU, RAM, swap, disk I/O usage

### **Key Components to Consider**
1. **Resource Utilization**
    - CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
    - Are system limits being exceeded?
2. **Processes and Services**
    - Are critical services running or failing?
    - Are there memory leaks or high CPU usage?
3. **Networking**
    - Packet loss, latency, firewall rules
    - External vs. internal connectivity issues
4. **Logs and Error Messages**
    - Kernel logs, system logs, application logs
    - Are there segmentation faults, crashes, or permission issues?
5. **Filesystem and Disk I/O**
    - Is the disk full? Are there corrupt files?
    - Are IOPS or read/write latencies too high?
6. **Security and Permissions**
    - Are there permission changes or failures?
    - Are there unauthorized access attempts?

## behavioral
A great Production Engineer tends to be strong in a few areas:
- Quick and continuous learner
- Ability to understand and concisely explain complex designs and problems
- Ability to determine and remember what is important and what are distractions.
- Ability to easily ascend and descend between layers of abstraction and to see the interactions of different design choices
- Good time management - especially ensuring that small things that unblock others or that have time constraints get done quickly, while making progress on larger work items.
- General professional work relationships - being able to work well with others - people with different personalities, people in different roles (whether in general, or just in this project), contributing appropriately in various fora (not sitting quietly, not dominating)
- General professional communication - letting people know your progress and what you need from them.

In terms of technical skills:  
- Solid understanding of how computers work, kernels, operating systems, tools to introspect what they are all doing. This is the vmstat/iostat/netstat/atop sort of system introspection commands, **understanding /proc data such as smaps/fd/etc**, data and memory allocation in heap/stack/data segment, **objdump/ldd/etc stuff, profiling tools**, ...
- Solid understanding of how networks work, the responsibilities and duties of various devices, the kernel, and userland processes, **failure cases (bad link quality/packet loss, misbehaving/broken devices doing full packet drops or forgetting connections or rehashing to a different flow) and the responses to those failure cases**, understanding of flow/congestion control.
- Ability to write good, idiomatic, code in various languages, in the prevailing style of an existing codebase (or company style, even if you dislike it), and to be able to conceptualise the working of the large code bases.

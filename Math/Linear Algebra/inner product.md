An inner product is a vector operation which maps two vectors to a scalar $V \times V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. The operation is represented between angled brackets, $\langle u, v \rangle$. 

To be considered an inner product, the operation must satisfy certain properties:
1. **Linearity**: $\langle au + bv, z \rangle = a\langle u, z \rangle + b\langle v, z \rangle$
2. **Symmetry**: $\langle u, v \rangle = \langle v, u \rangle$
3. [[positive semi-definite|Positive Semi-Definiteness]]

#### dot product
The **dot product** is an inner product for Euclidean spaces. For two vectors $u, v \in \mathbb{R}^n$, the dot product is
$$u \cdot v = u_1 \cdot v_1 + u_2 \cdot v_2 + \dots +  u_n \cdot v_n$$

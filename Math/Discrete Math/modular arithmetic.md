In a $\mod p$ universe, the only feasible values are $\{0, 1, \dots, p-1\}$. There are no negative numbers or fractions.

###### multiplicative inverse
The **multiplicative inverse** of $n \mod p$ is denoted $n^{-1} \mod p$. It is defined so that 
$$nn^{-1} = 1 \mod p$$
The multiplicative inverse of $n \mod p$ exists if and only if $n$ and $p$ are *co-prime*.

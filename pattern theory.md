In the study of visual [[perception]], many experiments have shown that the images humans perceive are not the true sensory signal we receive, but a rational reconstruction of messy and ambiguous raw light signals. **Pattern theory** is a field of [[artificial intelligence]] that attempts to replicate this skill computationally.

Pattern theory is closer to a sub-field of [[neural computation]], with the formal goal of the field being defined as "the analysis of the patterns generated by the world in any modality, with al l their naturally occurring complexity and ambiguity, with the goal of reconstructing the processes, objects and events that produced them."

### pattern reconstruction

>[!example] How is this different from the traditional approach?
>Consider the case of auditory perception. The pattern theoretic approach to a task like speech recognition would first aim to reconstruct the events in various muscles of the throat and mouth of the speaker, then to segment and label these events as producing specific phonemes, pitch, or stress.

Reconstruction is implemented as a combination of top-down and bottom-up processing.
- **Feed-forward**: Initial features from raw data are extracted and analyzed.
- **Feedback**: The brain uses this extracted data to compare with synthesized models, refining hypotheses about the observed signal through feedback loops.
- The process iterates, refining the analysis based on discrepancies between the synthesized pattern and the actual signal.
This iterative loop is crucial for handling noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete data, allowing the brain to generate a clearer, more coherent perception than what is provided by the raw input alone.

### estimating the world variables
Pattern theory employs probabilistic models and Bayesian statistics to reconstruct underlying patterns from data. 
- The brain learns these hidden variables through experience, refining its understanding of the world by minimizing the description length of observed patterns.
- Minimum Description Length (MDL): By compressing repeated patterns, the brain can create efficient models of the world, effectively learning through simplification.

>How can pattern theory influence [[interpretability]] and [[causal inference]]? The goals seem closely related.

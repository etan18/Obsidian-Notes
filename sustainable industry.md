### life cycle assessment
Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a standardized framework for evaluating the environmental impacts of a product or service. It evaluates a subject across all stages of its life cycle, including 
- Raw material production
- Manufacturing
- Distribution
- Use
- Disposal
Performing an LCA involves four iterative phases: goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory analysis, life cycle impact assessment, and interpretation.

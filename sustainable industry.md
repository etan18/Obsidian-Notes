### sustainability transitions
Sustainability transitions are major shifts in established industries, socio-technical systems, and societies toward more sustainable modes of production and consumption. These transitions are necessary to respond to [[climate change]] and overconsumption issues.

### natural capitalism
**Natural capital** includes all naturally-occurring resources, living systems, and ecosystem services. *Natural Capitalism* (1999) critiques the system of capitalism:
> It neglects to assign any value to the largest stocks of capital it employs — the natural resources and living systems, as well as the social and cultural systems that are the basis of human capital.

**Natural capitalism** is thus presented and introduces four important strategies to ensure that "the environment is not a minor factor of production but rather is an envelope
containing, provisioning, and sustaining the entire economy."
1. Radical Resource Productivity: slows resource depletion, lowers pollution, lowers costs for businesses
2. Biomimicry: redesigning industrial systems on biological lines to allow for resource reuse in closed cycles, reducing wasteful throughput of materials
3. Service and Flow Economy: calls for a fundamental change in the relationship between producer and consumer, a shift from an economy of goods and purchases to one of service and flow
4. Investing in Natural Capital: reinvestments in sustaining, restoring, and expanding stocks of natural capital, so that the biosphere can produce more abundant ecosystem services and natural resources.
### life cycle assessment
Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a standardized framework for evaluating the environmental impacts of a product or service. It evaluates a subject across all stages of its life cycle, including 
- Raw material production
- Manufacturing
- Distribution
- Use
- Disposal
Performing an LCA involves four iterative phases: goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory analysis, life cycle impact assessment, and interpretation.

### the earliest i.t.
The invention of **letters and numbers** were actually some of the first instances of *information technology* in history.

We can learn a lot about the nature of societal forms through the development of [[language]]. There are two main types of writing systems: logograms and alphabets.
### logograms
Logographic writing systems use characters to represent entire words, phrases, or concepts. 

### alphabets
The Phoenecians invented the earliest known form of *letters*. 

>[!question] Are all alphabets derived from the Phonetic alphabet?

Over time, dominant forms of writing systems have evolved from being pictographic, or *heiroglyphic*, towards primarily glottographic in structure.
- **Pictographs** are iconic representations of concepts. It may be the most intuitive, but at scale it is hard to assign icons to all concepts of meaning, especially abstract ones.
- **Glottographic** writing systems break down words into syllables, and further into letters.

### the importance of text
Information is easily lost in translation. Haphazard transmission of information can lead to misinterpreted or disintegrated ideas.

Plato
- "It is no true wisdom...telling them of many things without teaching them"
- Text is not inherently superior, cannot interact with it staticly
	- Think about what you're reading and why
	- Reliance on text can deteriorate memory
- Our engagement with each other matters, includes different manners of engagement, including spoken word.
Trithemius
- Text is superior to spoken word, believes in divinity of writing
- Press is lazy and temporary, but scribes and scriptures are divine
ibn-Khaldun
- Written word has a unique purpose

### print revolution
Printing led to the Renaissance, Protestant Reformation, and Scientific Revolution, according to Elizabeth Einstein.

Formal systems of organizing and documenting knowledge were developed in response to necessity during the European Enlightenment, a period of flourishing scholarship. Going back much further than this, there were still accounts of attempts to amass information into some central, organized space.
- *Thesauros* of Ancient Rome, they were warehouses full of texts and books
- *Naturalis Historia* by Pliny the Elder (77-79AD)
- *The Library of Alexandria*, which held 200,000+ books before being burned down during the Siege of Alexandria in 48 BC

>[!info] The European Enlightenment
>The European Enlightenment during the 18th and 19th centuries saw the emergence of modern libraries, modern museums, and great scientific and literary works, including the first Encyclopedia by Denis Diderot.

The need for **libraries** arose following the [[print revolution]]. As a concept, this would provide information access on a greater level to more people. 

Similarly, the **encyclopedia** was seen as a way to "change the common way of thinking" by standardizing "knowledge scattered around the world." Some contemporary analogies to the encyclopedia include Wikipedia and search engines.
#### diderot
Denis Diderot, who edited and translated the first Encyclopedia, categorizes knowledge into three categories:
1. **Memory**: scientific facts and observations of nature
2. **Reason**: conclusions drawn from observations of nature (i.e philosophy)
3. **Imagination**: works of fiction, created by human
This system was not intended by Diderot to be comprehensive, however.

## the earliest i.t.
The invention of **letters and numbers** were actually some of the first instances of *information technology* in history.

We can learn a lot about the nature of societal forms through the development of [[language]]. There are two main types of writing systems: logograms and alphabets.

**Defoe**

#### logograms
Logographic writing systems use characters to represent entire words, phrases, or concepts. 
#### alphabets
The Phoenecians invented the earliest known form of *letters*. 

>[!question] Are all alphabets derived from the Phonetic alphabet?

Over time, dominant forms of writing systems have evolved from being pictographic, or *heiroglyphic*, towards primarily glottographic in structure.
- **Pictographs** are iconic representations of concepts. It may be the most intuitive, but at scale it is hard to assign icons to all concepts of meaning, especially abstract ones.
- **Glottographic** writing systems break down words into syllables, and further into letters.

#### the importance of text
Information is easily lost in translation. Haphazard transmission of information can lead to misinterpreted or disintegrated ideas. These ideas contribute to the importance of [[print revolution|information authority]]. 

**Plato**
- "It is no true wisdom...telling them of many things without teaching them"
- Text is not inherently superior, cannot interact with it staticly
	- Think about what you're reading and why
	- Reliance on text can deteriorate memory
- Our engagement with each other matters, includes different manners of engagement, including spoken word.

**Trithemius**
- Text is superior to spoken word, believes in divinity of writing
- Press is lazy and temporary, but scribes and scriptures are divine
**ibn-Khaldun**
- Written word has a unique purpose
## counting systems
Mathematics can be practical, and there are logical answers to number patterns. The origins of numbers arose from the [[organization of knowledge]], and became popular specifically for applications to mercantile transactions.

Napier
- Global development of numbers
- Math is an iterative process

Al-Khwarizmi
- Influenced by religious beliefs
	> “Praise God the creator who has bestowed upon man the power to discover the significance of numbers. Indeed, reflecting that all things which men need require computation”

---
Jumping forward from the development of letters and numbers, the development of information technology shifted with the emergence of the [[print revolution]]. Now, *sharing* information became easier than ever, and the development of IT focused on further closing the gap between people.

Entering the 19th century, rapid development of technology enabled entry into the *age of electricity*. 
> "Only on looking back, fifty years later, at his own figure in 1854, and pondering on the needs of the twentieth century, he wondered whether, on the whole the boy of 1854 stood nearer to the thought of 1904, or to that of the year 1."
> - *The Education of Henry Adams*
### capturing information
The first photograph was captured in 1822 in France, followed by the development of the phonograph 1877 by Thomas Edison. These new forms of *capturing and reproducing* visual and audio information, respectively, were seen as new forms of "writing".

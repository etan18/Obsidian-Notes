**Time has been an important issue in several classes. Using at least two historical examples from the course, explore how it has been shown to give people control and, conversely, how it has allowed people to be controlled. In your conclusion, briefly discuss how analyzing these concerns historically can provide insight to how we use technologies today.**

Labor
- "My master told me that I had to produce a certain quantity of yarn; the hours were at that time fourteen; I said that I was not able to produce the quantity of yarn that was required; I told him if he took the timepiece out of the mill I would produce that quantity, and after that time I found no difficulty in producing the quantity"
- “If we were a quarter of an hour too late, they would take off half an hour; we only got a penny an hour, and they would take a halfpenny more.”
- “they must keep with the machine, and therefore however humane the slubber may be, as he must keep up with the machine or be found fault with, he spurs the children to keep up also by various means but that which he commonly resorts to is to strap them when they become drowsy.”




**Raymond Williams challenges people who believe that they can foretell the use of new technologies. He notes in particular how unpredicted and uncontrolled effects of technologies often defy expectations. Using at least two historical examples (with each example addressing a different technology), evaluate the usefulness of Williams’ observations. In your conclusion, using a present-day technology of your choice, briefly discuss whether Williams’s critique still relates to technologies today.**


To Williams, the development of information technologies were simultaneously "an intention and an effect of a particular social order" (Williams 132). This viewpoint directly situates technology as an integral piece of society, which makes it absolutely relevant to today's digital age. 

The most primitive example of how we cannot anticipate the effects of information technology comes from the earliest form of information technology--writing. Writing began as a way to store oral information in a way that could be "more forcefully implanted into our minds" (Trithemius). It is an information technology that has grown to be the origin of almost all of information technologies discussed in this class. The power of writing was found to be much greater than just storing oral information, it also established a "chain of transmitters leading back to their writers and authors", thus laying a foundation for information reliability. Off the backs of writing, we've witnessed numerous communication revolutions, including the print revolution, and the groundwork for all of society today. Looking at modern examples of information technology, we can similarly see a branching effect that could not have been anticipated at the inception of the information technology.

Particularly, we can take a look at the invention of cameras. The idea of cameras arose from a general demand for storing visual information. When it was first released, the "faultless fidelity of an instantaneous photograph" naturally assigned itself as the "very humble servant" of arts and sciences, with having "neither created nor supplemented literature" (Edison 641; Baudelaire). Nobody at this time really thought of photographs as something that could be artistic in nature. Then comes Edward Steichen, known today as one of the founders of photography as an artistic medium. To Steichen and those in his school of thought, there was never any such thing as "a purely impersonal, unmanipulated photograph" (Steichen). Steichen proved this to be true during his years as chief photographer at both Vogue and Vanity Fair, where he produced prints and fashion photographs that deliberately “regulates his time of exposure” and attends to the “detail, breadth, flatness or contrast” of his works (Steichen). Although this was not the intention of the inventor, subjective photography and filmography are widely respected artistic forms of expression today.

The development of information technology is interesting because of the unpredictable behavior that Williams' describes. Inventors, engineers, and scientists are *not* all-knowing, and oftentimes cannot anticipate how the public will interact with their inventions, and that's especially true in the digital age today, where more people are technologically literate than ever. Take video streaming, which in and of itself was developed as a result of previous inventions like the telephone, wi-fi, and motion picture. What began mostly as a way to share videos on YouTube has somehow snowballed into streaming services like Netflix completely outcompeting cable television into oblivion. This technology is also the basis for Facetime, which allows for "face"-to-"face" interaction without being in the same room. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we also saw how platforms like Zoom were able to completely transform modern corporate lifestyles to support remote and hybrid options. 

In sum, Williams' critique of the permeation of information technology not only holds up today, but it has even become incresingly accurate as time has gone on.


**The reliability and trustworthiness of information have been recurring themes in the course. Take two historical examples from the course and discuss how the problem of reliability and trust arose in those cases. In your conclusion, briefly discuss how these examples help us understand issues of information reliability today.**

In this class, the discussion of information reliability and trustworthiness has been a recurring theme. By looking closely into the development of both printing and advertising, we will see that these issues become especially poignant when financial interests become intertwined with information technologies.

The reliability of information became particularly of importance upon the invention of the printing press. This invention, which is widely regarded as one of the greatest of all time, allowed for the mass dissemination of information across entire societies. It began as just that--the "very humble servant" of the arts and sciences, "which have neither created nor supplemented literature" (Baudelaire). Over time, though, printing became one of the most lucrative industries, and many publishers began to value production output over quality content, outsourcing translations and labor to "any old obscure and uneducated monks, and even to little nuns, without any attempt at choosing those suited for the work" (Erasmus 21). The printing industry became both lazy and oversaturated all at once, creating a predatory market that sought profits above all else. During the Bancroft Library Tour, we were even shown published works of Charles Dickens, and how publishers released chapters of his books separately, such that readers would need to buy each edition separately, thus profiting more. 

On a similar note, advertising as an industry is inherently market-driven, as it is the "ready
method of informing the Publick of all that he desires to buy or sell" (Johnson 120). As it became a regular part of daily life, the public's "negligent perusal" of ads showed a growing desensitization (Johnson 121). The only way to stand out became through the "magnificence of promises," or, too commonly, the "corrupt" practice of "[attesting] the Cure, before [publishing] or [making] an Experiment of the Prescription" (Johnson 121; Steele 57). These bad habits from an entire industry may start as some form of sensationalism, but they snowball into overall predatory business practices. There are more comical cases, like the Subway "footlong" being only 9 to 10 inches, and then there's Elizabeth Holmes, whose company's success lay solely on her ability to deceive investors and market herself. These acts are all part of the "art" of advertising, but without proper checks in place, it does pose a true threat to information reliability.

These examples of profit-oriented information technologies seriously call into question the trustworthiness of information that we consume. As we've discussed in this class, lack of information reliability always stems from ulterior motives on the part of its author, and there is no greater motivation than money. We see this even today, **INSERT MODERN EXAMPLE**


**From Erasmus to the Royal Society and beyond, scholarship has tended to privilege certain groups or institutions, while condescending to other, "ordinary" people. Using at least two historical examples from the course (the two above, or others), discuss where we have seen such "ordinary" people pushing back against these assumptions, and briefly discuss how such cases relate to scholarship today.**

Scholarship, as with most other things, has long been dominated by "Companies all of one mind" (Sprat 73). Many perscpectives have been overlooked in history, mainly due to the fact that marginalized groups have not had the platform or access to education that would allow them to create spaces for themselves, and scholars have always tended to write things through a self-centered lens.

One such example is the discussion of labor during the Industrial Revolution, which were discussed in the readings from Duck and Collier. Stephen Duck's poem illustrates both a romanticized and male-centric point of view, which stems, obviously, from the fact that he is a man and also doesn't have the experiences of agricultural laborer, as he is a commissioned poet gifting this poem to a benefactor. The content of his poem describes the "briny Streams our Sweat descends apace" and the poor working conditions for male agricultural laborers, but addresses these conditions from the point of view of an objective observer (Duck). Collier responds to Duck's poem with her own. She intends to shed light on the female perspective, as she believes that Duck's failure to include women in his poem was intentional, and a sign of disrespect. Women were working in the "bright Orion glitters in the skies in Winter nights," and not only during Harvest seasons, which was the peak time for the male laborers described by Duck (Collier). In this case, the condescension arises from the failure to acknnowledge the female perspective, despite the amount of work they put into both the household and into agricultural jobs.

Furthermore, we can look to the journals of Christopher Columbus, who very clearly displays a Western, White-savior complex in his accounts. Columbus is driven by his desire for recognition as the visionary who "did not go by land to the eastward, as had been customary," but instead went westward and discovered new lands for the Spanish Kingdom to claim (Columbus 16). He views the natives of the land as "idiots" for bartering "cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars" (Columbus 8). His observations are untrustworthy for these obvious Western perspectives that do not acknowledge differing cultures. 

Scholarship today is improving, however there's still a long way to go. Modern movements have called upon scholars to be aware of their privilege and perspectives when writing, and to criticize how their experiences have shaped the way they think.

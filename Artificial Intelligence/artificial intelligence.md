The science of defining [[rational agents]] that [[cognitive architectures|think]] and act rationally.
>“For if every instrument could accomplish its own work, obeying or anticipating the will  of others, like the statues of Daedalus, or the tripods of Hephaestus, which, says the poet, "of their own accord entered the assembly of the Gods;" if, in like manner, the shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch the lyre without a hand to guide them, chief workmen would not want servants, nor masters slaves.” ~ Aristotle

## relation to the brain
We can't yet build AI on the scale of the brain--there's about 100 trillion synapses compacted into a human brain, and around 500 billion weights in state-of-the-art neural networks. And while the brain can be viewed as inspiration for AI, brains are not modular enough for us to reverse engineer.

Artificial intelligence has triggered many discussions on [[consciousness]] and the [[sentience]] of modern machines. Specifically, there's been a lot of interest in AI safety and ethics because of the dangers of how powerful these machines can be.

###### ai++
Superintelligent agents that far surpass human intelligence. 

> [!note] The Paperclip Maximizer
> The Paperclip Maximizer is a thought experiment that demonstrates the threats of a highly intelligent agent or AI whose goals are completely alien to ours. Here, a paperclip maximizer is a hypothetical AI whose goal is to maximize paperclips in the universe, a completely useless task. Such a machine with such a pointless goal could *pose an existential threat* by consuming resources essential to our survival.

# the history of ai

## precursors
###### charles babbage's analytical engine, 1834
Now recognized as the precursor to the computer, the machine was imagined to be a “general-purpose programmable computing machine”, which could add, subtract, multiple, and divide.
-   Design of the machine utilized punch cards, much like the Jacquard Loom invented in 1801
-   Was never executed in his lifetime, but it was the first artifact possessing the characteristics for universal computation

###### the eniac -- electronic numeral integral and calculator
World War II project led by Johns Mauchly, Eckert, and von Neumann
- Built off of an earlier concept, the **Antasoff-Berry Computer (ABC)** made in the 1930s, which was the first electronic digital computing device
- Utilized punch card design
- The goal was to calculate artillery tables for timing the launch of weaponry at moving targets
- Wasn’t completed until after the war ended, but successfully computed 1000x faster than previous methods
- Worked successfully, but was only able to solve systems of linear equations and had a deficient storage mechanism

###### a boolean circuit model of the brain, 1943
Created by McCulloch & Pitts
- Groundbreaking intersection between computer science and neuroscience
- Served as a precursor to neural networks

## the birth of ai

>An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists *work on it together for a summer*. 
>John McCarthy and Claude Shannon, 1956 Dartmouth Workshop Proposal

### alan turing (1912 - 1954)
Father of Theoretical Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence
**Turing Machine -** thought experiment that demonstrated the limits of mechanical computation
**Turing Test -** method of evaluating the [[sentience]] artificial intelligence
-   If a machine can pass the Turing Test, then it must be truly intelligent
-   A machine passes the Turing Test if a human cannot distinguish between the machine and another human

## evolution of approaches
Between 1970 and 1990, there were not many significant advances in AI. Most academia in the area explored knowledge-based expert systems. In the 1990s, there was a resurgence in AI developments, mostly using statistical approaches.

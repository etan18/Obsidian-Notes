Observation: in the mystery language, one noun appears 4 times. Assumption: professor and teacher are the same word.






Appears once: Professor --> Oogheed
**D-8: mapping out nouns, "Professor" and "Oogheed" appear only once in their respective languages.** 

Thus: Tool --> Eegee
**E-6: from D-8, we decipher that 'Tool' --> 'Eegee'.**

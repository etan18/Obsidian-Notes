We see objects because they reflect light. Light reflects in all possible directions from each point that it touches. Because of this, any pattern describing the object which the light is reflecting off of is lost. The question now becomes: how can we recover the pattern?

#### pinholes
Ibn Al-Haitham is the mathematician who invented the pinhole camera (camera obscura) between the 10th and 11th century. 

Pinholes filter out light rays that don't originate from a specific direction. This makes it such that only one ray of light from each point on the object will pass through the pinhole camera, thus allowing us to recreate the image on the screen which these rays are projects upon.

There are problems with the image produced by pinholes:
- Resulant projection is inverted (upside-down)
- The image is scaled (bigger or smaller) depending on the distance of the projection screen from the pinhole
- The main problem, though, is that because the pinhole is filtering out the vast majority of light rays, the resultant image is extremely *dim*.
To fix this problem of dimness and allow more light to pass onto the projection, we use lenses.
#### lenses
A converging lens employs **refraction** to bend light rays such that they are focused onto a single point. 

The distance from the lens at which all the rays converge is the **focal length** $f$. The shorter the focal length, the more powerful the lens. 
$$\text{lens power} = \text{refractive index} = \frac{1}{f}$$
The unit of lens power is *diopters*.

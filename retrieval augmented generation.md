**Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, better known as RAG, is a method employed by [[large language models]] to enhance the accuracy and credibility of responses by incorporating data from external knowledge bases.

Typically, an LLM relies solely on information seen during its pre-training phase, but there may be gaps in this knowledge (e.g. for domain-specific use cases or references to current events that occurred after pre-training).

### indexing
The first challenge of RAG is to store and represent external data in a way that is efficient to semantically search and retrieve later on. 
- **Convert to plain text**: external knowledge bases generally contain documents in diverse formats like HTML, PDF, Word, etc.
- **Chunking**: to accommodate the context limitations of LLMs, text is segmented into chunks
- **Encoding**: each chunk is encoded into a vector representation using an embedding model
These vector representations are generally stored in [[vector databases]].
### retrieval step
The process of retrieving relevant information typically looks something like this:
1. **Encode the query** using the same embedding model used during indexing
2. **Compute similarity scores** between the query vector and vectors stored in the vector DB
3. **Retrieve the top-$k$** most similar chunks using cosine similarity
The selected chunks are concatenated to the original query and used as additional context in the prompt.
#### re-ranking
Performing vector search to rank the relevance of chunks of data poses several problems:
- Compressing large chunks of texts into numerical vector representations leads to information loss, particularly of nuanced details.
- Using the top-$k$ selection method may cause us to leave out important pieces of information that fall just under that top-$k$ threshold. It's infeasible to increase the number of chunks retrieved because of the limitations of the context window size.
To minimize the noise inputted into the LLM, we add a new process of **re-ranking** after the initial vector search is performed.

Because vector search is efficient, we still use it to retrieve *all* relevant chunks from the vector database at high speeds. After retrieving this set of documents, the re-ranker is applied to prioritize the most relevant chunks at the top before applying top-$k$.

Re-ranking models are generally implemented as cross-encoders that process the query and relevant chunk together to assign a relevance score. This is more precise than simply using a cosine similarity metric between two vectors.

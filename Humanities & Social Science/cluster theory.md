In economics, **cluster theory** advocates for the existence of *localized industries*, or industries which are primarily concentrated in a single region or area. Cluster theory was proposed by Alfred Marshall in 1890.

#### localization
The localization of industry arises in multiple ways.
- **Physical conditions**: the climate and terrain of an area can make it more suitable for certain trades (e.g. nearby mines, fertile soil)
- **Economic factors**: demand for certain skills and necessary trades 

Localized industries create specialized public spheres which, by definitioin, allows for the sharing of ideas and fosters innovation within that locale.
- Concentrating the industry into a single locale creates a consolidated labor market. 
- Increased opportunities for shared resources or supply chain optimizations
- Localized industries are liable to extreme economic depression.

There are many different types of clusters that we can observe. 
- **Geographical clusters**: concentration of business in a single geographic area (e.g. California wine country)
- **Sectoral clusters**: aggregation of businesses operating in the same industry (e.g. Silicon valley)
- **Horizontal clusters**: networks of competing businesses with the same customer base (e.g. marketplaces, farmer's markets)
- **Vertical clusters**: partnerships between businesses at different stages of the supply chain

#### supplementary industries
One shortcoming of cluster theory and localized industries comes from situations where the labor market is uniform. For example, labor-intensive local industries can shift the demographic of the area to be overwhelmingly male. This would create a labor vacuum for the wives of laborers in the area.

What we often see as a natural remedy to this problem is the conjoined formation of supplementary industries in the same area. In this example used by Marshall, iron districts are typically also home to textile factories.

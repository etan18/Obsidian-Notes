### sustainability transitions
Sustainability transitions are major shifts in established industries, socio-technical systems, and societies toward more sustainable modes of production and consumption. These transitions are necessary to respond to [[climate change]] and overconsumption issues.

>[!tip] Creative Destruction
>Creative destruction is a process in capitalist economies where new innovations constantly replace old technologies, products, and industries. The intuition is that incumbent companies have financial stake in existing technologies, and are not likely to push for innovation. This cycle of "creative destruction" is essential for economic growth and innovation.

>The concept was introduced by economist Joseph Schumpeter, who won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Economics for this work.

### natural capitalism
**Natural capital** includes all naturally-occurring resources, living systems, and ecosystem services. *Natural Capitalism* (1999) critiques the system of capitalism:
> It neglects to assign any value to the largest stocks of capital it employs — the natural resources and living systems, as well as the social and cultural systems that are the basis of human capital.

**Natural capitalism** is thus presented and introduces four important strategies to ensure that "the environment is not a minor factor of production but rather is an envelope
containing, provisioning, and sustaining the entire economy."
1. Radical Resource Productivity: slows resource depletion, lowers pollution, lowers costs for businesses
2. Biomimicry: redesigning industrial systems on biological lines to allow for resource reuse in closed cycles, reducing wasteful throughput of materials
3. Service and Flow Economy: calls for a fundamental change in the relationship between producer and consumer, a shift from an economy of goods and purchases to one of service and flow
4. Investing in Natural Capital: reinvestments in sustaining, restoring, and expanding stocks of natural capital, so that the biosphere can produce more abundant ecosystem services and natural resources.
### life cycle assessment
Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a standardized framework for evaluating the environmental impacts of a product or service. It evaluates a subject across all stages of its life cycle, including 
- Raw material production
- Manufacturing
- Distribution
- Use
- Disposal
Performing an LCA involves four iterative phases: goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory analysis, life cycle impact assessment, and interpretation.

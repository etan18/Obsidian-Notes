### resiliency
Today, supply chains are distributed, global networks. The fragility of these networks has been seen when disruptions to even one node in the network can have crippling effects to the entire chain. These disruptions include
- COVID-19 pandemic
- Geopolitics, including tariffs and Trump's trade war
- [[Climate change]]
- Single instance disruptions, such as the blockage of the Suez Canal (2021) or avian flu breakouts
These instances demonstrate the need for more resilient supply chains, which can withstand unforeseen circumstances to keep supply steady. Some strategies for resilience include **diversification** of suppliers, such that if one supplier is disrupted we have other suppliers in other parts of the world which are likely unaffected. **Nearshoring** or **onshoring** of suppliers provides resilience to geopolitical disruptions.
#### lean supply chains
There is a need for lean supply chains which can iterate and adapt quickly. **Just-in-time (JIT)** production is a manufacturing strategy where products are made only as they are needed (i.e. when ordered), with the goal of reducing waste and increasing efficiency.

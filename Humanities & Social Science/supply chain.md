>[!tip] Economies of Scale
>**Economies of scale** are a key concept in microeconomics, describing the cost advantage a company gets from producing goods in large quantities, which lowers the average cost per item. This happens because fixed costs, like rent, are spread out over more units, and bigger production volumes allow for bulk discounts on materials and more efficient, specialized labor.
### resiliency
Today, supply chains are distributed, global networks. The fragility of these networks has been seen when disruptions to even one node in the network can have crippling effects to the entire chain. These disruptions include
- COVID-19 pandemic
- Geopolitics, including tariffs and Trump's trade war
- [[Climate change]]
- Single instance disruptions, such as the blockage of the Suez Canal (2021) or avian flu breakouts
These instances demonstrate the need for more resilient supply chains, which can withstand unforeseen circumstances to keep supply steady. Some strategies for resilience include **diversification** of suppliers, such that if one supplier is disrupted we have other suppliers in other parts of the world which are likely unaffected. **Nearshoring** or **onshoring** of suppliers provides resilience to geopolitical disruptions.
#### lean supply chains
There is a need for lean supply chains which can iterate and adapt quickly. **Just-in-time (JIT)** production is a manufacturing strategy where products are made only as they are needed (i.e. when ordered), with the goal of reducing waste and increasing efficiency.

## distribution
**Distribution** is the step of the supply chain that deals with moving a product from the manufacturer (**point-of-origin**) to the final customer (**point-of-use**). It is a key component of supply chain logistics. At a high level, distributors can be thought of as trucking and warehousing companies.

There are a few key distinctions here:
- A distribution center is used for bulk storage and B2B bulk sales between the manufacturer and a retailer, for example.
- A **fulfillment center** is used to package, process, and ship DTC sales

Distributors may be all-encompassing [[food systems#3. distributor|broadliners]], which provide a wide variety of products so that retailers can procure all their goods from the same place, reducing deliveries and dropoffs. Amazon, which operates as a DTC retailer and has historically been classified as a "marketplace facilitator", was probed in 2024 by the Federal Trade Commission into being reclassified as a distributor. This distinction would make Amazon liable for recalls and defective products under **Chain of Distribution Liability** laws.

**Third party logistics providers** (3PLs) offer logistics services, such as warehousing, shipping, returns, and inventory management, on behalf of companies. 3PLs can be non-asset-based, meaning they do not themselves own the warehouses or the trucks, rather they connect businesses with trucking and warehousing companies and organize the logistics between them.

When things go wrong in life (and they will), you need to be prepared to incur unexpected costs that could be detrimental to finances, such as death, medical problems, loss or damage to your home or car. 

In most cases, you may be able to cover unexpected expenses using [[savings]], specifically from your **emergency fund** (recommended to be ~25% of total savings, or 6 months of must-have expenses). These should *not* be made using your [[credit]] card, because the point of accumulating an emergency fund is to avoid putting yourself at risk of racking up debt, including credit card debt.

>[!warning] Don't Insure the Small Stuff
>For smaller purchases, such as home appliances, most companies will offer **extended warranties**, which is essentially like insurance. However, in the long run, you will be expected to pay out much more money from unused warranties than you will save from replacing small items that break within 1-2 years of purchase. For that reason, it is *not* recommended to buy extended warranties on smaller purchases, and just incur the full cost in the rare situations where the warranty would kick in.

However, when costs are too great to even be covered by your emergency fund, you need to make sure you have **insurance** to protect yourself from financial ruin in these situations. The tricky parts of getting insurance is knowing
1. What type(s) of insurance you need
2. How much coverage to get
## policies
The cost of insurance is broken down into several components:
- **Premium**: annual fee to be covered by insurance. The charged premium will be high enough to cover expected claims, and give profit to the company.
- **Deductible**: the amount you need to pay out-of-pocket for an expense before insurance kicks in.
	- Higher deductible --> lower premium
- Even after you've met your deductible, insurance will still not cover *all* of the rest of the incurred expenses. These costs are in place to de-incentivize the overuse of services, such as physician appointments. The amount you pay of the rest is determined by
	- **Coinsurance**: percentage of the cost that the insured person pays, and the insurer pays the rest (e.g. 20% of the medical bill is paid by you, 80% covered by insurance)
	- **Copay**: fixed dollar amount the insured pays, regardless of total cost

When shopping for insurance, make sure to get quotes from multiple companies. Some insurance companies may give price breaks/discounts when you purchase different types of insurance from them. 
#### risk
One problem with insurance is the presence of **adverse selection**, wherein people who are more likely to file claims are also more likely to purchase insurance. For example, elderly people are more likely to buy life insurance than young people, and people with health conditions are more likely to buy larger health insurance plans. 

For this reason, insurance companies adjust the price of insurance policies based on the risk a particular policyholder faces. In some cases, they may refuse to sell insurance to people who face too great a risk. This risk assessment is done through **underwriting**.

>[!danger] Correlated Risks
>Because of the structure of mutual insurance, wherein policyholders pay a fixed **premium** to the pool, and that money is used to pay for claims, insurance policies work best when they are covering risks that are unlikely to occur and random.
>
>When a certain risk is likely to result in many policyholders filing claims at the same time (e.g. an earthquake), insurance companies may need to pay out a lot of money for a lot of claims all at once. These are known as **correlated risks**.

**Moral hazards** are situations where one economic actor has no incentive to reduce their risk because they do not bear any of the consequences or liability if things go wrong. If an insurance company provides full, unconditional coverage on something (e.g. an expensive necklace), the policyholder has no incentive to protect or hide the necklace because they can always get the money back if it gets stolen.

For this reason, insurance companies put certain terms in place:
1. Explicit conditions: claims are only eligible if certain conditions are met (e.g. the necklace was taken directly from inside a locked safe)
2. Less than 100% coverage: the policy may indicate that only a percentage of the losses incurred will be covered, or coverage only goes up to a certain limit.

### health insurance
Everybody needs health insurance. Most people receive health insurance coverage from their employer, and those who don't can receive it by enrolling in Obamacare, the federal program for universal healthcare. 

Many people receive health insurance through their employers, who take out large, group policies. This is favorable for insurance companies because it helps avoid adverse selection (low probability of *all* employees being in poor health). This is known as a **risk pool**, where grouping people together makes it such that premiums from healthy people subsidize claims made by unhealthy people.

The two main types of healthcare plans are **HMO** or **PPO**:
- **Health Maintenance Organizations**: lower costs, but less provider choices
	- Put utilization controls to regulate costs. For example, you may only see in-network physicians. You may also need to be referred by a primary care physician to be able to see a specialist.
- **Preferred Provider Organizations**: higher costs, but more options
	- You can choose to see an out-of-network physician (though it'll cost more)

>[!aside] Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)
>An HSA is a pre-tax savings account to set aside money for qualifying medical expenses. They are usually coupled with high-deductible health insurance plans. You and/or your employer will make annual contributions to an HSA that can be used later on.
>
>HSAs are favorable if you're healthy, because you can save money in a tax-advantaged account while paying lower premiums on your health insurance.
##### medicare
Medicare is the federal health insurance program (overseen by the Social Security Administration) that primarily covers people who are either
- Over the age of 65
- Have permanent disabilities
- Have any stage of renal (kidney) disease
You should sign up for Medicare Part A as soon as you are eligible for it (3 months before 65th birthday). The window to sign up ends at the end of the third month after your birthday (7 month total window).
- If you are not yet retired and still have employer healthcare coverage, you may want 

The basic parts of Medicare are 
- Traditional Medicare
	- **Medicare Part A**: hospital insurance (free, no monthly premium)
	- **Medicare Part B**: supplemental medical insurance
- **Medicare Part C**: Medicare advantage -> you opt out of having the government pay your claims, use a private plan instead. 
- **Medicare Part D**: prescription drugs
- **Medigap**: supplemental policies to defer the costs of coinsurance or deductibles
##### affordable care act
Prior to the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) in 2010, 47 million Americans did not have health insurance. To prevent adverse selection, ACA requires everyone to have health insurance, otherwise face a penalty of 2% of annual income. In order to help individuals comply, the ACA increases access to affordable healthcare through
- Expanded employer-based insurance - requires employers with over 200 employees to offer health insurance
- Expanded Medicaid - broadened eligibility to include lower-income individuals
- Healthcare Marketplace in which people cannot be denied insurance because of pre-existing conditions
	- Insurance companies are prohibited from using gender as a basis for setting different premiums --> led to men paying more in insurance
- Allowing individuals to remain on parent's healthcare plan until age 26
### homeowners insurance
If you own a home, you need homeowner's insurance. Homeowner's insurance covers damage or loss of your home or the possessions in it, including damages from theft or liability from people who do not live in your home getting injured on the premises.
- **Cash value policy**: covers the cost of damages *after* depreciation. Should generally be avoided.
- **Full replacement cost policy**: covers the cost of damages not including depreciation (covers more, costs more)
- **Named perils policy**: covers fewer, explicitly-named risks
##### renters insurance
Renter's insurance is not always necessary, but recommended if you have valuable possessions in your rental unit or you want liability protection if someone who doesn't live there is injured in your rental unit. 

### auto insurance
If you own a motor vehicle, you need automobile insurance. Each state has mandated minimum coverage limits, but these are generally too low. 
- **Liability coverage**: should cover at least
	- $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident
	- $100,000 bodily injury liability per person
	- $50,000 property damage liability
- **Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**: covers unpaid damages if you get into an accident with an uninsured or underinsured motorist, or in the case your car gets stolen or is the victim of a hit-and-run. Necessary.
- **Collision coverage**: covers damage to your car, even if you are at fault.
- **Comprehensive coverage**: covers damage to your car from anything other than collision, including theft, vandalism, natural disaster
	- With collision and comprehensive, only insure up to book value of car
- **Medical payments coverage**: covers medical expenses for you and passengers of your car, regardless of who was at-fault
Car insurance follows the *car*, not the driver (except in the case of rental cars). Depending on the state you live in, you either have "fault" or "no-fault" insurance:
- **Fault**: the driver deemed at fault is responsible for paying *all* damages from the accident
- **No-fault**: the at-fault driver covers property damages, but each person covers their own personal injury costs. These states usually require drivers to have **Personal Injury Protection** (PIP) to cover these expenses.

### life insurance
The general rule of thumb for life insurance is that if there are people in your life who depend on your income (e.g. children, spouse), you should have a life insurance policy. Otherwise, you don't need it. There are two types of life insurance:
- **Term life policy**: get this. Pays out your death benefits to your beneficiaries if you die within the term specified by the policy (e.g. 20 years).
	- Much cheaper and simpler than cash value policies. Lower commissions to agents.
	- **Level term**: type of term life policy where premium is fixed over the whole term
- **Cash value policy**: don't get this. These policies, also known as permanent life insurance, can either be whole life, universal life, or variable life policies.
	- Also pays out death benefits to beneficiaries
	- Tax sheltered investment for you to borrow and pay premiums for the rest of your life. In most cases, this is not preferred, because its better to save for retirement separately from your insurance policy in a 401(k) or Roth IRA.

Your life insurance premium is set based on your risk factors, such as age, health, and lifestyle habits. These are provided to the company from health examinations and surveys. 
- **Contestability period**: around 1-2 years from the policy's effective date, wherein a company can investigate you if they believe you lied on your application. If they find that you did lie, they may not pay out claims and you could be charged with **fraud**.
	- Insurance company will not pay out death benefits if you die by suicide during this time.

### disability insurance
**Disability insurance** protects your income if you are sick/injured/unable to work. 1 in 4 people in their 20s will need some form of disability insurance before retirement.
- Short term disability: covers for a fixed amount of time (e.g. a year). Sometimes provided by employer, and not always necessary if emergency fund can cover expenses.
- Long term disability: recommended if you work and are not close to retirement age.
	- Buy enough to cover must-have monthly expenses
- Government disability: state/federal protections that apply to specific situations
	- Workers compensation: covers injuries sustained on the job. Payments vary depending on state, but the most it covers is 66% of gross wages or 80% of take-home pay, with a max ceiling
	- Social security disability: only eligible for people unable to work *any* job, and must be confirmed by a doctor.
	- Veterans disability
	- State disability insurance
- **Annually renewable disability income** (ARDI) policies start with lower premiums, that may be raised each year you renew. This may be a good option if you have limited income.
The cost of disability insurance depends on many factors, including age, gender, and occupation. Women pay 30-50% more for disability because they may become pregnant. 
There is also usually a stipulated **waiting period**, which is a designated time of being unpaid before disability insurance kicks in (longer waiting periods --> lower premiums).

Other types of insurance you may need include
- **Long-term care insurance**: if you are of retirement age
- **Umbrella insurance**: provides additional liability coverage beyond primary insurance
	- If you have much more wealth than the liability insurance limits on your auto or homeowners policies, consider buying umbrella insurance as a supplement
- **Pet insurance**: most people should self-insure
- **Travel insurance**: most people should self-insure, unless you are at an unusually high risk for needing to make a claim

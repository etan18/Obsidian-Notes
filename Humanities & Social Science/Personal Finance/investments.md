>[!idea] Summary of Investment Basics
>1. Invest in mutual funds or ETFs
>2. Choose low-cost index funds
>3. Pick a mix of stock and bond funds

For financial investments, **asset allocation** involves deciding how to divide your investments among different asset classes. The three main asset classes are
1. **Equities**: stocks (US and international)
2. **Fixed income**: bonds (government, municipal, corporate)
3. **Cash**: money in accounts, money markets, certificates of deposit
Cash is less volatile than stocks and bonds, but don't earn as much of a return.

The **disposition effect** is a phenomenon in [[behavioral economics]] observing the tendency for investors to sell stocks that have made good financial gains, and hold on to poorly performing stocks.

**Diversification** means reducing the *volatility* of your investments without reducing your expected return.

When it comes to investing in companies, there are two types of investments: lending investments and owning investments. 
## bonds
Bonds can be thought of as a loan you pay

The return on an investment for someone with a bond-like investment is based on the **interest** earned, as well as the **capital appreciation**.

## stocks
The return on an investment for shareholders is based on the **dividends** payments receive, as well as the **capital appreciation**.
- Dividends are the stockholder's share of the profits
- Capital appreciation (or depreciation) is the change in value of a stockholder's share of the company
Stock funds face infrequent, but large losses. In general, stocks are much riskier investments than bonds.

>[!warning] Why is it hard to beat the market?
>Net annual losses from individual trading rack up to 2.2% of the GDP. Individual losses represent an overall 3.8% reduction in annual portfolio performance, whereas individual gains represent only 1.5% increase in annual portfolio performance.

Changes in stock prices are determined by many factors, including the general state of the economy and changing interest rates. Lower interest rates makes bonds less desirable to investors and makes it easier for companies to borrow.

Other factors that can increase stock prices include
1. Increasing inflation: equities hedge inflation better than bonds
2. Positive investor sentiment
3. Weakened collective bargaining: lower wages -> more profit for companies
4. Fewer regulations: easier for companies to do business
5. Growth in private equity: lowers supply of publicly traded stocks
6. Lower corporate taxes: more money for companies and shareholders
7. Lower personal capital gains taxes
8. Increased working-age population and shift from traditional pension to defined contribution pensions, such as a 401(k)
Many of these are **common factors**, meaning that if they impact one company's stock, it's likely that many other companies will face similar impacts. While diversification can eliminate independent risks specific to individual companies, it cannot eliminate risks from common factors, like a weak economy.

##### risk vs. reward
The tradeoff between risk-taking and expected returns on investments is complex. Investments with higher expected returns *do* imply higher risk, but not all high risk investments necessarily expect high returns. 
- Market forces guarantee this tradeoff - if a company had low risk and high returns, over-buying of stock will raise the price of shares so that the return lowers until convergence
- However, the market does not protect against low return, high risk stocks. The market adjusts prices for common factor risks that can't be avoided through diversification, but that doesn't prevent investors from trading on speculation or taking unnecessary risks.

## other investments
Other types of investments include
- **Options**: contract where one party sells the right to buy or sell something (e.g. 100 shares of a stock), at a predetermined price, by a specific date.
- **Futures**: contract where one party promises to sell and the other promises to buy a specified security (e.g. 100 shares of a stock) or commodity (e.g. oil) on a future date for a pre-determined price in a pre-determined location.
Options and futures are both **zero-sum games**. If the buyer of an option gains a dollar, the seller loses a dollar (in general, but there are also intermediate transaction costs involved).
##### commodities
Commodities include agricultural products and natural resources, such as corn, sugar, oil, and precious metals. They are typically traded as futures contracts on **commodities exchanges**, such that the buyer and seller are not communicating directly, but through the exchange. 

The vast majority of individual investors who trade commodities end up losing money, and these investments are typically not recommended or appropriate for most individual investors.

>[!example] What is an Index?
>An **index** is just a list of stocks, bonds, or other securities. The S&P 500 is an example of a *market index* is a list of the 500 largest companies in the US. The index value is calculated by averaging the price of all the companies on the index. The companies in the S&P 500 represent about 75% of the value of all publicly-traded companies in the US, making it the most common benchmark for companies and other funds to try to beat.
## mutual funds
A **mutual fund** is an investment company that pools your money with that of other investors. Buying mutual funds is the easiest way to diversify your investments. There are three types of mutual funds: open-ended funds, exchange-traded funds, and closed-ended funds.

Open-ended funds are the most common. They can be bought and sold directly through mutual fund companies (e.g. Vanguard or Fidelity) or brokerage firm (e.g. Charles Schwab or Morgan Stanley).
- Don't buy mutual funds with **load fees**. These are commissions charged by the mutual fund company.
- Don't focus on past performance when buying mutual funds. Focus on diversification, asset allocation, and fees.
- Actively managed funds with a dedicated portfolio manager tend to underperform the market more often than outperforming it. They also tend to be less diverse than index funds.

### exchange traded funds
Exchange traded funds are bought and sold through a financial advisor, brokerage firm, or mutual fund company in much the same way that stocks are bought and sold. These funds hold a collection of securities that can be traded intra-day, not just at the end of the day.
- Check for commissions and expense ratios
- More tax-efficient than index funds, and usually have lower fees

### index funds
The easiest way to diversify your investment portfolio is by buying broad-based, low-fee **index funds**. Index funds are a type of mutual fund which holds a representative sample of stocks from some index (e.g. S&P 500 or all-market index) that it tracks and tries to match. Index funds are a popular investment choice because they are
- Inexpensive
- Well-diversified
- Liquid
- Relatively tax efficient
They work well in well-regulated markets that have lots of active management. The U.S. is considered a well-regulated market, meaning there is a limited amount of fraud.

>[!tip] Buy well-diversified funds with low fees.

Buying index funds are considered a form of *passive investment* because it doesn't require as much active decision as, say, stocks and bonds. They do come with a few downsides, though, including
- Overvalued stocks are overweighted
- Voting rights are concentrated at mutual fund companies (e.g. BlackRock & Vanguard)
- Index funds may contribute to mispricing in poorly regulated markets

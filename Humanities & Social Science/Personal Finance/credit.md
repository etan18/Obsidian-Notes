## credit cards
A debit card is very similar to paying cash: it instantly deducts money from your account, is usually also an ATM card and can also be used to get cash back at retailers.
- Difficult to overspend or overdraw
- No annual fees
- No perks or rewards programs
- Does not impact credit score, and purchases don't show up on credit report

In contrast, a **credit card** allows you to borrow money to make purchases. After getting approved for a credit card, you are extended a **credit line** based on your income and credit score, which is essentially your borrowing limit for a given month.

Credit cards offer many benefits, including consumer protections and rewards perks.

>[!warning] Always pay your entire credit card balance every month.
>Credit card debt is a huge problem in the US, as the interest rates charged on top of unpaid balances is extremely high (15-30%). For this reason, don't spend on your credit card if you can't pay it off in full.

#### credit cards and wealth disparity
Credit cards are a much more advantageous financial tool for the wealthy, usually at the expense of the less wealthy.

> In 2022, credit card fees caused Americans with family incomes of less than $75,000 to send a cumulative $3.5 billion to families with incomes above that level. More than a billion of this total came from families making less than $20,000, and $1.9 billion went to families with an income of $150,000 or more.

It's very easy to treat credit cards as "free money", but without the ability to pay back the balance every month, credit card debt will accumulate exponentially. 

#### paying off credit cards
There are a few key dates and numbers to keep track of with your credit cards. For dates, you have your
- Closing date (e.g. the 18th of every month) - the boundaries for your statements
- Payment due date (e.g. the 15th of every month) - when you need to have made at least the minimum payment for your previous month's statement
And for values, you have your
- **Statement balance**: amount accrued between the previous and current closing dates (e.g. between September 18 and October 18). *This is the amount you need to pay off before your current due date.*
- **Current balance**: sum of statement balance + charges that took place after the closing date to today
- **Minimum payment due** (e.g. $35): smallest amount of money you must pay each month to keep your account in good standing to avoid late fees and penalty APRs. 
	- You should *not* be only paying the minimum amount due, because any unpaid balances will accrue interest.

## credit score
**Credit score** is a metric used to represent the likelihood that a consumer will pay back a loan. Different *credit reporting agencies* (e.g. Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) use different formulas to calculate credit score. Your credit score plays a factor in
- **Lending**: whether or not you will get approved for a loan, as well as the terms of the loan that you get.
- **Renting**: landlords may use credit score as a sign of reliability with payments
- **Insurance policies**: the rates in your policy will be higher for people with bad credit
- **Utilities**: any service that you utilize before paying (e.g. electricity or phone bills)
- **Employment**: many prospective employers, particularly in retail, may check credit score as a determinant for hiring

The **FICO score** is the most common credit score. 
- It ranges from 300 to 850, where higher is better and the median FICO score is $\approx 712$
- Most credit reporting agencies calculate a FICO score in addition to their own proprietary credit score.
### factors of credit score
The most important contributing factor to your credit score is **payment history**; this makes up about 35% of your FICO score.

The rest of the FICO credit score is made up of
- **Credit utilization**: how much you owe vs. your credit limit (30%)
	- Should keep this under 10% by paying your statement balance before the due date. This is usually calculated within 3 days after your closing date.
- **Length of credit history** (15%): average age of credit accounts
	- Tip: open a low/no-fee credit card ASAP and just keep it open
- **Recent credit applications**: many credit score inquiries will lead to a lower score (10%)
	- Hard pull: when a lender checks your credit (requires SSN). Only do this for a good reason!
		-  Tip: get all quotes for things like mortgages or auto loans in the same 1-2 week period. These will all be counted as one credit score inquiry.
	- Soft pull: when you check your own credit report, for things like pre-approval offers or checks from existing lenders. These *do not* affect your credit score.
The final 10% is made up of other factors, like the composition of your credit (typical mix of loans and credit cards). Things not considered in your credit score are your income and demographics.

### credit reports
Credit reports are used by credit reporting agencies to calculate credit scores. It is a detailed account of your credit history, almost like a log or ledger of past payments.
- **Late payments** (over 30 days late pay a lender or creditor) can stay on your credit report for up to 7 years
- Bankruptcies can stay on your credit report for up to 10 years

>[!important] Check your credit report for errors
>Each of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) is required to offer a free credit report request every 12 months.

#### budgeting
In *All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan* by Elizabeth Warren and Amelia Warren Tyagi, they suggest a budgeting plan that tracks only three, high level categories:
- Must-haves: necessary expenses that you would still need to pay even if you lost your job (e.g. rent, bills, insurance, debt)
- [[savings]]: 401(k) contributions, emergency funds
- Wants: anything else that you spend money on that is non-essential
A good target breakdown for most people of how your after-tax income should be divided amongst these three groups is **50%** for must-haves, **20%** for savings, and **30%** for wants. 

# accounts
In general, an **account** is an agreement between you and a business (e.g. a bank, brokerage, or utility company) that stores a record of transactions, such as deposits, withdrawals, purchases, and payments. Accounts are generally associated with
- An account number
- Your name
- A current balance (what you own, or what you owe)
A **checking account** is the most common type of bank account and is used for everyday spending. It allows you to deposit, withdraw, and transfer money. Most checking accounts pay little to know interest, and may require a monthly fee or minimum balance.
#### savings account
A **savings account** has most of the same basic functionality as a checking account, with the added benefit of *earning interest*.
- *High-yield* savings accounts are ones that pay out actually competitive interest rates
#### investment account
- Can be opened at a bank, brokerage firm, mutual fund
	- Popular discount brokerages (Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab)
	- Day trading platforms (Robinhood) - should be mostly for entertainment, not primary investment account
- Deposit money to buy and sell [[investments]] (e.g. mutual funds, stocks, bonds, crypto)
- Balance is the value of what you currently own (cash + assets)
- Some investment accounts are tax advantaged (e.g. 401(k), IRA, Roth IRA)
- May receive interest/dividend payments
#### loan account
When a bank or other institution lends you money (e.g. for a mortgage or auto loan), you make payments to a **loan account**.
- Balance is how much you currently owe
- Charges interest
#### credit card account
- Make charges to [[credit]] card
- Make payments
- Charged interest on unpaid balance
- Balance is how much you currently owe

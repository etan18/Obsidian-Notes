At least 20% of your after tax income should go towards savings. Savings are needed for many different reasons, all of which protect your future.
- At least half of your savings being contributed to your IRA, 401(k), or other retirement account.
- 25% of savings should go towards saving up for future expenses you know you'll need to make---this could be a down payment on a home or car, education funds for you or your children, or anything like that.
- 25% of savings should just go towards a security (or emergency) fund in case of unforeseen obstacles. Your security fund should always have *at least* six-months worth of must-have expenses in it.
Your savings should be kept in a typical (high-yield) savings account or money market account. It should not be in an illiquid or volatile [[investments]] account like a certificate of deposit or stock account (respectively). It should also not be in your checking account because that would be too accessible.

>[!tip] Automate Savings
>As a tip to keep yourself accountable for meeting spending goals, set up automatic monthly contributions to your retirement account and other savings accounts. Have these payments scheduled for the beginning of the month or payment cycle, before you're able to spend any of your income on wants.


Tips for maximizing savings:
- If your employer makes matching contributions to your 401(k) retirement plan, always contribute enough to the plan to get the entire match. This will ensure you get the most money from your employer.
- Save for your retirement first, then your child's education
- Save more tomorrow - commit in advance to increasing your savings rate annually or after each raise, and/or commit to putting your federal tax return into savings.
- Focus on the big stuff: doing your research and being diligent with large expenses like insurance policies and mortgages, as saving in these areas are likely to lead to more savings (comparison shop).
	- Live within your means
- Save first, then buy - don't buy on [[credit]]

## interest
There are two main types of *interest*: **compound interest** and **simple interest**. Simple interest looks at the initial contribution (e.g. $\$100$) and computes the yearly interest based only on that value. So, at an interest rate of $10\%$, you would earn exactly $\$10$ in interest each year. 

In comparison, compound interest recomputes the interest earned based on the amount in the account *at that time*, meaning you earn interest on top of interest earned in previous years. This results in an exponential progression, for example
- Year 1: $\$100$ initial contribution
- Year 2: $\$110$, $+\$10$ interest

For example, if we have an $8\%$ rate of return, it will take $72 / 8 = 9$ years to double your money.

# financial goals

The **SMART format** for setting financial goals requires them to be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. For example, let's say you want to buy a house. You could formulate this as a SMART goal by saying

> I am going to save and invest $650/month for the next 8 years, so I can have $60k for a down payment on a house by the time I'm 32.

### saving for retirement
Money for retirement will be supported by
- Social Security
- Personal savings
- Pension
The **asset allocation** of your retirement accounts is one of the biggest ways you can customize your retirement plan. These investments should be divided amongst domestic stocks, international stocks, and domestic bonds.

>[!tip] Take more risks when you're younger, and be safer closer to retirement.
>Most financial experts recommend investing more in stocks when you're younger, and more in bonds closer to retirement. Some rules of thumb include investing $(100 - \text{your age})$% in stocks and $(\text{your age})$% in bonds.

Your Social Security and pension are similar to investments in US bonds, so take that into account when diversifying your retirement accounts.
#### retirement accounts
There are two primary retirement accounts: IRA and 401(k). Both have Roth and Traditional options, which just determines when the money you deposit into your account gets taxed (now or later).
- An **IRA** can be opened by anyone and withdrawing money is more flexible. There are income limits and a deposit limit of $7,000 per year
- A **401(k)** defined contribution plan must be opened and dictated by your employer, but there are no income limits and comes with a deposit limit of $23,000 per year, not including employer match.
**Target date funds** automatically adjust your asset allocation as you age. Most 401(k)
 plans allow you to specify a *target date* for retirement.
#### social security
Social Security was a federal program that started during the Great Depression as part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. It is set up as a pay-go system wherein current retirement benefits are paid for by current members of the workforce. Once these workers retire, they will get to reap the benefits from future workers.
- If you are healthy, begin claiming Social Security benefits at age 70, no earlier no later. Social Security benefits are adjusted according to change in cost-of-living, so monthly payments will be higher the later you claim.

### spending in retirement
The **4% rule** is a simple rule of thumb for determining how much you can spend each month in retirement. It basically says that the first year after you retire, you can spend 4% of your total savings. Each subsequent year, you can spend the same amount, adjusted for inflation.
- Spending power is irrelevant of investment returns

**RMD Approach**
**Required minimum distribution**: minimum amount the IRS requires you to withdraw from Traditional retirement accounts (*does not apply to Roth*), starting from the calendar year you turn 70.5
- Calculated from a **withdrawal factor**, where your $$RMD = \text{Previous Year-End Account Balance } / \text{ Withdrawal Factor}$$
The RMD approach says you should withdraw and spend the RMD from your retirement savings (even if you have Roth) each year, as well as your Social Security benefits. RMD calculations adjust for life expectancy and portfolio returns.

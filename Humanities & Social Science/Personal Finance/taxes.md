**Sales taxes** are state-dependent, but can be augmented on a district or city level. These apply to the purchase of any non-necessities (as defined by the state, but usually excludes things like groceries or medicines, and sometimes clothes).
- In CA, there is 7.5% statewide sales tax, and an additional 1.5% sales tax imposed by the City of Berkeley. Five states have no sales tax (Alaska, Delaware, NH, Oregon, Montana)
- **Excise taxes**: imposed on certain goods, such as alcohol or cigarettes

**Property taxes** are state-dependent and assessed based on the value of your property (e.g. home, car, boat). In CA, the property tax rate is 1% of the assessed value of your home, which is the amount that you bought the home for, plus up to 2% in appreciation every year. These rates are capped by Prop 13.

**Estate taxes** are collected on the net value of all your assets once you die. This tax rate is quite high (40%) but only applies to estates that exceed $14 million (in 2025). Only about 0.14% of estates will pay any estate tax.

### income tax
Income taxes are collected at both the federal and state levels. Income taxes are computed on a **progressive scale**, meaning that the more you earn, the more taxes you pay. However, the same rate does not apply to *all* your income, or even all your *taxable income*. 
- For the first $X you make, the tax rate is ~9%
- For the next $X - $Y you make, the tax rate is ~15%
- For the next $Y - $Z you make, the tax rate is ~25%, and so on and so forth
The exact rates and income brackets are dependent on your filing status (e.g. Single, Married filing jointly, Married filing separately).

>[!tip] Taxable Income
>The amount of your income that is actually taxable is the total amount you make (including tips, royalties, unemployment compensation, and short-term capital gains) minus three things:
>- **Adjustments**: contributions to tax-deferred retirement accounts, tuition and fee deductions
>- **Deductions**: property taxes, state/local taxes, donations, interest portion of mortgage
> 	 Federal government also offers standard deduction of $14,600 (in 2024 if Single), which can be taken without itemizing all deductions
>- **Exemptions**: $3,950 (in 2014) per every person your income supports (including you)
> 
> Adjusted gross income (AGI) is your total income minus only adjustments. AGI is used in computing other income deductions.

The estimated amount of income tax you'll owe is determined by your W-4 form. That amount is withheld by your employer to cover those estimated taxes. Every year by April 15 (**Tax Day**), you need to file your annual taxes, from which you may either need to 
1. Send more money if your withheld tax is less than the total amount owed
2. Receive a tax return from the government if you paid too much throughout the year

**FICA taxes**, also known as **payroll taxes**, are federally-imposed and were enacted by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. These are usually taken from your salary, but likely not other income like investment gains or interest. FICA taxes consist of a few components:
- **Social security**: 6.2%, taxed on up to $117,000 of income (as of 2014)
- **Medicare**: 1.45%, no salary limit
- **Medicare surcharge**: 0.9% if salary above $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (married)
	- Only applied to salary portion above the threshold
FICA taxes are applied onto money put in retirement [[savings]] accounts, which is different from traditional income taxes, which are not imposed until after the money has been taken out of the account.

**Capital gains** taxes are applied to money earned from holding an asset and making a profit off of it. Normally, assets held for under a year are lumped in as income. But when assets are held for over a year and sold for a profit, they are taxed as capitals gains, a much lower rate than the marginal income rate.

### tax credits
**Tax credits** reduce your final tax bill dollar for dollar. Some common tax credits include
- Child care: $1,000 per child
- Hope credit and Lifetime learning credit: applies to education expenses
- Adoption tax credit

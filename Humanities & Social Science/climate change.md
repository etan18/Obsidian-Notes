#### greenhouse gases
Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are a class of gases in the atmosphere that trap heat by absorbing energy that reflects off the Earth's surface, typically from the sun. Major GHGs include
- Carbon dioxide (CO2) - 79% of Earth's GHG
- Methane (CH4)
- Nitrous Oxide (N2O)
- Water Vapor
- Fluorinated gases e.g HFCs, CFCs
The **greenhouse effect** is the process of trapping heat from the sun that has allowed Earth to sustain life for millions of years. However, increased GHG levels from human development has caused too much heat to be trapped in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.
##### carbon
**Fossil fuels**, such as coal, petroleum (oil), and natural gas, are non-renewable energy sources and the primary contributor to excess CO2 in the atmosphere. This is because, in order to produce energy, these fuels need to be burned in the presence of oxygen. This process, called **combustion**, produces CO2 as a byproduct that is released into the atmosphere.

**Critical minerals**: essential materials deemed necessary to national security
- needed for the green transition
- e.g copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, REMs
**Conflict minerals**: minerals from mines in armed conflict areas 
- e.g. DRC, which produces 70-80% of global cobalt, often traded illicitly and facing ongoing civil wars over control of the mines
**Rare-earth minerals** (REMs): named so because of the difficulty of accessing, mining and processing them. 
- China is the largest producer of rare-earths

### renewable energy
Three key levers—electric vehicles, heat pumps, and renewables—can cut down reliance on fossil fuels.

One of the biggest barriers to clean energy comes from its **overcapacity** problem. This occurs when global production capacity for clean energy technologies, such as solar panels and batteries, exceeds the sustainable demand. Overcapacity drives down clean energy prices, which some argue deters expansion of clean energy. This is particularly salient in China, where substantial government subsidies are said to be the driving force of overcapacity.

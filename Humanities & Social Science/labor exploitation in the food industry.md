US [[food systems]] account for $2.2 trillion in goods and services annually. At every level, there exists exploitation in the food chain.

Tipped wage originated post-slavery, as a way for freed slaves to be paid without receiving a real wage. Today, the federal minimum wage for tipped wage sits at $2.13 an hour, compared to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour for non-tipped workers.

## farmworkers
Much of U.S. produce is imported from Mexico, as well as South and Central America. California is the nation’s leading producer of fresh fruits and vegetables, but many of the farmworkers are latino themselves.
#### supermarkets
Supermarkets are the primary purchasers of fresh produce. The U.S. supermarket industry is an oligopoly, meaning it’s dominated by a few large corporations, which may each own numerous supermarket chains. These few corporations—including Walmart, Kroger, and Publix—set the price for the goods, and decide how much of the profits trickle down into further parts of the [[supply chain]].

#### the bracero program
(_1942 to 1964_)
The Bracero Program was a temporary worker program that allowed Mexican citizens to work in the United States as agricultural laborers. The program was designed to meet the labor demands of American agriculture during and after World War II.
- Over 4.5 million Mexican citizens hired → one of the largest population movements
- Opportunity for higher wages which were still considered cheap labor to Americans
- The Mexican government received remittance, which at one point became its 3rd most profitable industry

>[!warning] Labor Exploitation
>Despite providing employment opportunities for many Mexican workers, the program was criticized for its poor working conditions, low wages, and lack of legal protections for workers. Bracero workers were prohibited from joining unions, and ones who protested were sent back to Mexico.

The flow of undocumented migrants into the U.S. was accelerated by the Bracero Program, and subsequent agricultural trade agreements between the U.S. and Mexico. Overall, the Bracero Program became of the largest anti-labor ploys by large corporations and lobbying parties ever.

The UN estimates that 1 in 9 people worldwide are hungry—meaning their average caloric intake is below minimum energy requirements (a **calorie deficiency**).

The *amount* of available food is not the issue, but access to quality, nutritious food is. The UN’s study on global malnutrition found that an estimated 1 in 4 people worldwide suffer from nutritional deficiencies.

In the US, rural communities comprise 63% of all U.S. counties but 87% of counties with the highest food insecurity rates. The primary challenge for rural residents is the prevalence of low-access food deserts, where the distance to supermarkets impedes the ability of consumers to access a wide range of food.

A few solutions to this problem may be
- More direct-to-consumer delivery models that bypass the need for full grocery stores in areas that cannot sustain one.
- Innovation with driverless or drone delivery.

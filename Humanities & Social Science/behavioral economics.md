**Behavioral economics** is a field that studies how cognitive, psychological, and behavioral factors impact people's economic decisions.
### the standard economic model
The standard economic model assumes optimal decision making, or *[[rationality]]*. It also assumes that 
- agents are purely selfish, meaning they always make the best choice for themselves
- there is a smoothly discounted expected utility over time
- we have infinite computational power
- decisions are frame-insensitive, meaning context is not considered
In behavioral economics, all of these assumptions go away, to hopefully create a more realistic model to better represent how humans actually behave in the real world.

### behavioral factors
#### cognitive bias

Psychological biases occur in many different forms:
- **Anchoring**: allowing irrelevant information to affect our estimates or views on something
- **Default choice**: people are far more likely to stick with a "default" option rather than intentionally switch their choice, despite intrinsic preferences

**Self-attribution bias** is the tendency for people to credit themselves when things go well, and blame others when things go bad.
#### social preferences
Much of existing economics assumes that people are selfish. While that's mostly true, people do tend to consider others when making economic decisions. Formally, this means that our **utility** may depend on the utility of others.

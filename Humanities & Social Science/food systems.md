### supply chain
In general, a **supply chain** can be broadly conceptualized as the interaction between various entities which are involved in the flow of products and services to their end customers.

The food supply chain is unique and consists of many stages:
1. **Farm**: primary production, the actual grower of crops, produce, livestock, etc.
	- For local farms, farmers markets may make up some portion of the farm's revenue stream. While it is expensive to attend a farmer's market (transportation, labor, licensing), farmers are also able to keep 100% of revenue by selling direct-to-consumer, instead of losing a cut to distribution centers.
	- Aggregator: business, cooperative, or NGO that consolidates products from multiple (usually smaller) farms to give increased market access to small farmers, create a larger, more consistent supply, and pool resources between smaller farms.C
2. **Producer**: handling and storage, only a small percentage of crops are sold as fresh produce---the rest is used to make all the other goods you may find at a grocery store, including sauces, prepackaged foods, powders, dried goods, etc.
3. **Distribution center**: processing and packaging, act as a middleman connecting producers with buyers. 
	- Food hub: specialized distribution focusing on locally sourced foods. Provide "market access" to smaller farmers/producers.
	- Packaging is a big issue in the food supply chain, both in terms of cost and waste.
4. **Wholesale/Retail Sales**: can be B2B or B2C, e.g. restaurants or grocery stores that buy goods in mass quantities
5. **Consumer**: demand, aka "fork"
These interconnected parts are heavily reliant on one another. Smaller farms may only have a few buyers act as a large portion of their revenue stream, or vice versa.

Food supply chains face unique challenges that question the applicability of general supply chain strategies. For example, 
- Safety stock: holding additional goods to meet demand fluctuations is not easily transferable to food supply chains due to the challenge of product deterioration, perishability, and waste.

>- Lack of stakeholder support or participation
>- Competing values and priorities (when sustainability impacts the bottom line)
>- Producer or distributor constraints
>- Misaligned incentives for decision makers (lobbying!)

## retail sales
The biggest consideration for food producers is sales.
#### certifications
A common market solution to ensuring the quality of produce (on axes like sustainability, locality, worker conditions) is through third-party certifications.
- **USDA Certified Organic**
	- Non-GMO
	- No synthetic fertilizers or pesticides
	- 3-year transition period, soil must go 36 months without being treated with prohibited substances
	- For packages goods: no artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives
	- For meat, dairy, eggs: no growth hormones or antibiotics
- **Certified Humane**: sets animal welfare standards for meat, dairy, and eggs 
- **Fair Trade**: Requires supply chain audit to ensure safe working conditions, sustainable livelihoods/wages, and environmental protection measures
Certifications are generally expensive to obtain, and require rigorous auditing. To consumers, certifications are an impactful method of signaling company values, but it's important to recognize that obtaining certifications are essentially just checking a set of boxes and may not be feasible for smaller producers to obtain, even though they may be ethical actors.

## food waste
An estimated one-third of global food production becomes food loss and waste. Combined with high rates of food insecurity and food deserts around the world, this signals a major failure of current food systems. These failures arise out of
- A mismatch between food prices and production costs: when production costs rise, food prices increase, which may leave more food unsold and unconsumed. When prices are low relative to production costs, it may not be profitable for farmers to produce and sell.
- Deficiencies in public infrastructure: there are not many structures in place that can redirect food waste to those in need (e.g. food banks, shelters)

>[!warning] Bycatch
>In the fishing industry, **bycatch** is the discarded biomass of marine animals caught accidentally that fishermen do not want, cannot sell, or cannot keep. These animals commonly suffer injuries or die due to these encounters.
>
>This is a big problem ecologically and economically, as bycatch can slow the rebuilding of over-fished areas, put at-risk species in further danger, or damage marine habitats.

# the U.S. food system
The US had historically run an agricultural trade surplus up until 2019 when, for the first time in over 50 years, became a net-importer of agricultural products. These deficits are mostly with Mexico---in 2019, we imported $15.7 billion in fruits and vegetables from Mexico alone, up to $21 billion in 2023.

The US is focused on growing and exporting low-cost corn and soybeans, which are primarily used for livestock feed, ethanol, and to make cheap sugars, starches, and oils.
- **Commodity crops**: can be traded on commodity markets; limited to wheat, corn, sorghum, barley, oats, cotton, rice, peanuts, soybeans, certain oilseeds, dry peas, lentils, and chickpeas.
- **Specialty crops**: any non-commodity crop, including fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, culinary herbs and spices, medicinal plants, and floriculture.
This difference is important because the USDA financially supports commodity crops through federal programs, incentivizing large-scale production of those crops. On the other hand, the US Farm Bill makes it much harder to produce specialty crops, which are typically grown on small to medium sized farms.
#### U.S. agricultural policy

U.S. agricultural policy has two consistent main themes:
1. The use of food as a **diplomatic tool**.
2. Controlling the price of food and avoiding volatility.
Other federal programs may go towards supporting farmers through grants, subsidies, or other means.

Dating back to Eisenhower's presidency (1953-1961) during the Cold War, the U.S. sold surplus agricultural stocks to ally nations lacking food supplies on lenient loan terms. They also contributed to UN organizations, NGOs government-to-government donations for emergency needs. This was initially meant to be short-term policy to handle **agricultural surplus**, but has remained a mainstay of U.S. foreign policy.

Federal subsidies for farms date back to WWII, when they were introduced in order to keep food prices down during the WWII and the tail end of the Great Depression.
- **Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA)**: New Deal program designed to raise crop prices to make farming a viable living again. The idea was to reduce surpluses by paying farmers to leave their land fallow, destroy crops, or kill off livestock.

#### the case for local
**Local and regional food systems are more resilient to changes.** For example, during COVID, many large supermarkets experienced shortages, but local farms were still able to produce at healthy capacities. Additionally, during recent avian flu outbreaks which saw shortages in eggs, many local suppliers were still able to supply at normal amounts.

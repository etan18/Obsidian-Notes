## supply chain
In general, a **[[supply chain]]** can be broadly conceptualized as the interaction between various entities which are involved in the flow of products and services to their end customers. 

Food supply chains face unique challenges that question the applicability of general [[supply chain]] strategies. For example, perishability management is crucial to food supply management, requiring relatively short chains and rapid turnover to prevent spoilage. 
- Safety stock: holding additional goods to meet demand fluctuations is not easily transferable to food supply chains due to the challenge of product deterioration, perishability, and waste.

The food supply chain is unique and consists of many stages:
##### **1. farm** 
The farm, also known as **primary production**, the actual grower of crops, produce, livestock, or other raw materials which can either be consumed fresh or used to make value-added food products.

Only a small percentage of crops are sold **direct-to-consumer** (DTC). For local farms, DTC channels like farmers markets may make up some portion of the farm's revenue stream. While it is expensive to attend a farmer's market (transportation, labor, licensing), farmers are also able to keep 100% of revenue by selling direct-to-consumer, instead of losing a cut to distribution centers.

>[!tip] Aggregators
>An aggregator is a business, cooperative, or NGO that consolidates products from multiple (usually smaller) farms to give increased market access to small farmers, create a larger, more consistent supply, and pool resources between smaller farms.
##### **2. producer/manufacturer** 
Only a small percentage of crops are sold as fresh produce---the rest is used to make all the other goods you may find at a grocery store, including sauces, prepackaged foods, powders, or dried goods. **Food production** is the umbrella term for large-scale industrial processes that convert raw agricultural materials into processed, edible products for a larger market. Food manufacturing generally refers to the transformation into finished, packaged products.

- **Private label**: products made by third-party manufacturers sold under a retailer or distributor's brand name (e.g. Trader Joe's, Kirkland, Whole Foods 365)
	- Food manufacturers bid on private label to produce certain items for the retailer
	- Retailers control product design, specs, and pricing without needing specialized production facilities
- **White label**: generic products made by third-party manufacturers that are sold under different brands with minimal customization. This is different from private label where brands create whole product lines that meet their designated quality or standard. In white-labeling, brands take the generic product as-is and market it.
- **Co-packing/Co-manufacturing**: copackers package and label food products made by manufacturers.

>[!tip] Cottage Industries
>Cottage industries are small businesses which operate from a home, often producing goods through craft, small-batch, and traditional methods. These businesses may be start-ups or just intentionally artisanal.
>
>Many states have separate laws/policies for cottage industries compared to commercial businesses. These regulations, often called "cottage food laws," are designed to create exemptions for small, home-based food producers from the more burdensome requirements of commercial food establishments.
##### 3. distributor
A **distribution center** handles storage (warehouses) and transportation (trucking) and act as a middleman connecting producers with buyers. 

Broadline [[supply chain#distribution|distribution]] is a business model most commonly seen in the food service industry, wherein distributors act as a "one-stop shop" for all food service operators. This means they offer fresh produce, frozen food, and even restaurant and cooking supplies. In the US, there are three major **broadliners**: Sysco, US Foods, and Performance Food Group (PFG).
- Food hub: specialized distribution focusing on locally sourced foods. Provide "market access" to smaller farmers/producers.

>[!tip] Redistribution
>Redistribution is the practice of moving resources from distributors and manufacturers to retailers. It is a component specific to food supply chains for fulfilling small, high-cost-to-serve orders, such as to restaurants, institutions, or smaller retailers and wholesalers.
>
>At a major scale, the cheapest method of transportation for distributors is to load an entire truckload of a single item---most small retailers don't need that much. A redistributor takes these mass quantities of goods and warehouses them to fulfill small-to-midsize orders which may combine, say, half pallets of 50 different items and ship them to the end customer.
##### 4. wholesalers/retailers
Wholesalers or retailers are the consumer-facing outlets, primarily including supermarkets and restaurants that buy goods in mass quantities to sell to consumers. These can also include schools, hospitals, or companies that offer cafeteria services, or the food services companies (e.g. Aramark, Sodexo) that are employed by institutions.

**Buyers** or procurement managers for these places stock food products based on consumer demand or consumer expectations. From a logistics standpoint, buying through distribution minimizes the amount of drop-offs and increases convenience for buyers.
##### 5. consumer
Demand, aka the "fork" in "farm-to-fork".

These interconnected parts are heavily reliant on one another. Smaller farms may only have a few buyers act as a large portion of their revenue stream, or vice versa.


>[!idea] Barriers to Executing Change in Supply Chains 
>- Lack of stakeholder support or participation
>- Competing values and priorities (when sustainability impacts the bottom line)
>- Producer or distributor constraints
>- Misaligned incentives for decision makers (lobbying!)

## retail sales
The biggest consideration for food producers is sales. When items are sold through retail outlets, such as supermarkets or wholesalers, there are a few key considerations from different stakeholders. 

For the retailer, deciding what items to place on the shelves is determined by anticipating customer demand---this is done by the **buyer** or **procurement** team, typically segmented by category. Deciding *where* on the shelf to place items can be contractual, where the manufacturer pays a **slotting fee** to get more ideal (eye-level) placement; or, it can be used to signal retailer values, placing healthier or more popular items at eye level. 

From a manufacturer perspective, they may want to create a **brand block**, which is a merchandising strategy such that all products from the same brand are grouped together at the **point-of-sale** to create a visually striking presence on the shelf. 
#### packaging
Packaging serves many purposes:
- Marketing
- Convey information: nutritional labels, nutrition facts, certifications
- Convenience of consumption
- Food safety: some packaging is mandated by the USDA, can reduce liability for the manufacturer
Most food and beverage products include some type of single-use packaging. The environmental cost of packaging is typically far less than either 1) impacts on the farm or 2) wastage along the supply chain, but is an issue that has gained a lot of publicity.

**Consumer packaged goods** (CPGs) are non-durable items which are used regularly and replaced regularly. Food items are CPGs (as opposed to durable goods), as are things like toiletries and cleaning supplies. Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) are a subgroup of CPGs with especially high turnover rates; for food products, this includes products with shorter shelf lives.

Most single use packaging is non-recyclable, and there are barriers to widespread adoption of **post-consumer recycled** (PCR) plastic packaging, including:
1. High collection costs
2. Complex sorting
3. Unknown contamination leading to safety concerns.

The **Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) Law** requires food retailers (e.g. supermarkets) to identify 1) the country of origin and 2) the method of production at the point of sale. The law applies to certain "covered commodities", including meat, seafood, fruits, and vegetables, but generally does not apply to processed foods.

#### certifications
A common market solution to ensuring the quality of produce (on axes like sustainability, locality, worker conditions) is through third-party certifications.
- **USDA Certified Organic**: federal standard for organic food
	- Non-GMO
	- No synthetic fertilizers or pesticides
	- 3-year transition period, soil must go 36 months without being treated with prohibited substances
	- For packages goods: no artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives
	- For meat, dairy, eggs: no growth hormones or antibiotics
	- State-level organizations like CCOF (California) and Oregon Tilth also have organic certs, but after the introduction of Certified Organic, mostly do auditing of farms on behalf of USDA
- **Certified Humane**: sets animal welfare standards for meat, dairy, and eggs 
- **Fair Trade**: Requires supply chain audit to ensure safe working conditions, sustainable livelihoods/wages, and environmental protection measures; addresses [[labor exploitation in the food industry]]

Certifications are generally expensive to obtain, and require rigorous auditing. To consumers, certifications are an impactful method of signaling company values, but it's important to recognize that obtaining certifications are essentially just checking a set of boxes and may not be feasible for smaller producers to obtain, even though they may be ethical actors.
## food waste
An estimated one-third of global food production becomes food loss and waste. Combined with high rates of food insecurity and food deserts around the world, this signals a major failure of current food systems. These failures arise out of
- A mismatch between food prices and production costs: when production costs rise, food prices increase, which may leave more food unsold and unconsumed. When prices are low relative to production costs, it may not be profitable for farmers to produce and sell.
- Deficiencies in public infrastructure: there are not many structures in place that can redirect food waste to those in need (e.g. food banks, shelters)

>[!warning] Bycatch
>In the fishing industry, **bycatch** is the discarded biomass of marine animals caught accidentally that fishermen do not want, cannot sell, or cannot keep. These animals commonly suffer injuries or die due to these encounters.
>
>This is a big problem ecologically and economically, as bycatch can slow the rebuilding of over-fished areas, put at-risk species in further danger, or damage marine habitats.

**Extended producer responsibility (EPR) laws** make food producers, including manufacturers and brand owners, financially and operationally responsible for the end-of-life management of their products and packaging. 
- Shifts the burden of waste collection, recycling, and disposal from local governments and taxpayers to the producers
- Encourages more sustainable, less wasteful, and more easily recyclable products. 
- EPR laws are being introduced at the state level (as of November 2025, introduced in 7 states and proposed legislation in at least 8 more).

# the U.S. food system
The US had historically run an agricultural trade surplus up until 2019 when, for the first time in over 50 years, became a net-importer of agricultural products. These deficits are mostly with Mexico---in 2019, we imported $15.7 billion in fruits and vegetables from Mexico alone, up to $21 billion in 2023.

The US is focused on growing and exporting low-cost corn and soybeans, which are primarily used for livestock feed, ethanol, and to make cheap sugars, starches, and oils.
- **Commodity crops**: can be traded on commodity markets; limited to wheat, corn, sorghum, barley, oats, cotton, rice, peanuts, soybeans, certain oilseeds, dry peas, lentils, and chickpeas.
- **Specialty crops**: any non-commodity crop, including fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, culinary herbs and spices, medicinal plants, and floriculture.
This difference is important because the USDA financially supports commodity crops through federal programs, incentivizing large-scale production of those crops. On the other hand, the US Farm Bill makes it much harder to produce specialty crops, which are typically grown on small to medium sized farms.
#### U.S. agricultural policy
U.S. agricultural policy has two consistent main themes:
1. The use of food as a **diplomatic tool**.
2. Controlling the price of food and avoiding volatility.
Other federal programs may go towards supporting farmers through grants, subsidies, or other means.

Dating back to Eisenhower's presidency (1953-1961) during the Cold War, the U.S. sold surplus agricultural stocks to ally nations lacking food supplies on lenient loan terms. They also contributed to UN organizations, NGOs government-to-government donations for emergency needs. This was initially meant to be short-term policy to handle **agricultural surplus**, but has remained a mainstay of U.S. foreign policy.

Federal subsidies for farms date back to WWII, when they were introduced in order to keep food prices down during the WWII and the tail end of the Great Depression.
- **Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA)**: New Deal program designed to raise crop prices to make farming a viable living again. The idea was to reduce surpluses by paying farmers to leave their land fallow, destroy crops, or kill off livestock.

#### the case for local
**Local and regional food systems are more resilient to changes.** For example, during COVID, many large supermarkets experienced shortages, but local farms were still able to produce at healthy capacities. Additionally, during recent avian flu outbreaks which saw shortages in eggs, many local suppliers were still able to supply at normal amounts.

# sustainable agriculture

For decades, the bulk of food in the US has been produced through **industrial agriculture**, a system of large factory farms which typically employ practices like
- **Monocropping**: growing large amounts of the same crop/crops, which can be damaging to soil health because the same crops over-utilize the same nutrients.
- **Conventional farming**: the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that are polluting to the soil, air, and water.

A new wave of **sustainable agriculture** aims to build environmentally, economically, and socially responsible systems of farming. 

The field of **agroecology** specifically looks at the science of managing farms as integrated ecosystems.
- Crop rotations
- Planting cover crops
- Reducing tillage
- Regenerative agriculture
	- Integrating livestock and crops

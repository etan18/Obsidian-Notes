**Technological determinism** is a reductionist theory on the effects of technology in society. Specifically, technological determinists believe that
1. Technology shapes society more than society shapes technology, and technology is the *main* thing that shapes society.
2. Technological advancements have inherent social consequences.

### the medium is the message
This argument was presented by Marshall McLuhan in 1967, and is the most famous argument in favor of technological determinism. 

McLuhan argues that technological advancements are inevitable, so we as a society need to adapt as new innovations come out.
> "When IBM discovered that it was not in the business of making office equipment or business machines, but that it was in the business of *processing information*, then it behan to navigate with clear vision."


### critiques
Symptomatic technology is the antithesis of technological determinism. This class of thought believes that technological innovations are symptomatic of broader societal context.

Williams' argument takes a more nuanced approach which does not align with either technological deterinism or symptomatic technology. Instead, he posits that social conditions lead to new technology, which leads to new social conditions.
- Technology is both "an intentention and an effect of a particular social order" (Williams 132).

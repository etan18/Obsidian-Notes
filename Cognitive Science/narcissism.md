Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a mental health condition characterized by over-inflated self-images which can cause destructive and dangerous behaviors.

#### malignant narcissism
Defensive phenomenon that is a particularly severe and damaging wherein subjects are dedicated to maintaining moral purity. This causes the self-image of a malignant narcissist to be anchored in a grandiose self-image of moral goodness. 

In attempts to preserve this self image, they resort to a number of defensive tactics and rationalization methods:
- **Dormant conscience**: for most people, the conscience places moral constraints on behavior. In contrast, the conscience of a malignant narcissist is forced into a state of dormancy by continual acts of self-deception 
- **Psychological projection**: externalizing our own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, and attributes to other people
- **Scapegoating**: a common form of projection, specifically projecting responsibility and blame onto other people. Because narcissists are incapable of viewing themselves as bad or evil, they must instead view others as bad or evil.

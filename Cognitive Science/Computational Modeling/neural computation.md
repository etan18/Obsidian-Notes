What is the difference between neural computation as a field of study in comparison with [[artificial intelligence]]? The primary difference involves the tradeoff between functional competence (i.e. results) versus computational efficiency. 
- **Artificial intelligence**: models and algorithms prioritize outcomes and performance metrics, at the cost of intensive compute and memory, and oftentimes uninterpretable or black-boxes algorithms. The goal is to mimic the *inputs and outputs* that a human brain would produce.
- **Neural computation**: investigates principles of the brain that allow us to compute outputs so efficiently.

## physics of computing
In hardware, the **"Von Neumann" computing architecture** is what we see in almost all modern computers. It essentially includes non-overlapping modules for computation and memory, relying on a bus to communicate between the units.

This separation, although most widely used, has also created an industry-wide limitation on throughput called the *Von Neumann Bottleneck*.

**Neuromorphic computing** is a field dedicated to building physical computational systems based on the organizing principles of the nervous system and the brain.

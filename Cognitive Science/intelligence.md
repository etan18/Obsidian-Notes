A survey of proposed definitions of intelligence.

### gardner's theory of multiple intelligences, 1983
Intelligence is the sum of a person's *domain knowledge*, or different frames of mind. **Frames of mind** are different fields in which someone has knowledge. Knowledge in these contexts includes skills and talents. Some examples include musical intelligence or mathematical intelligence.

Gardner's theory is particularly robust because of its ability to capture skills like *spatial intelligence* (athleticism), *interpersonal intelligence* (social skills), and *intrapersonal intelligence*. 

### sternberg's triarchic theory of intelligence, 1985
Sternberg proposed that there are three types of intelligence.
- **Practical intelligence:** working to make everday life more manageable, or better
- **Creative intelligence:** adapting to new tasks and situations, and automating the processing of familiar information ([[learning]])
- **Analytical intelligence:** procedural memory

### soar, 1990
*Soar: an architecture for general intelligence* was published by Alan Newall in 1990. Soar is an acronym for  **state**, **operator**, and **result**. It's a rule-based architecture comprised of IF/THEN statements. 

[[learning|Learning]], using this architecture, occurs when we reach an impasse that we don't have a pre-defined rule for. This is when new rules and splits get made.

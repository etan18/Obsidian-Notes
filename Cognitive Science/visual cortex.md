## eyeball structure
- **Iris** is a biomarker more unique than the fingerprint
- **Sclera** is the white of the eye, hard shell
- **Pupil** is where light enters
- **Cornea** is the transparent surface on the outside of the eye, which does most of the focusing. Because it touches air, its much stronger than the lens.
- **Lens** is behind the cornea, used for fine-tuning (*accomodation*). It sits in an aqueous solution which dampens its lens power. 
- The **optic disk** at the back of the eye is where the optic nerve leaves the eye to connect with the brain. This is a blind spot.

>[!information] Contralateral organization
Both of our eyeballs each perceive the *entire visual field* (both left and right visual fields). However, because of the laws of [[optics]], the image they produce is inverted. Because of this, information from the right visual field (from both eyeballs) is sent to the left visual cortex for processing, and vice versa.
### retina
The retina is a layer at the back of the eyeball that is lined with photoreceptors.
#### photoreceptors
**Photoreceptors** use *transduction* to convert light into chemical or electrical signals. They eye contains two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones.
- **Rods:** scotopic vision (low light), smaller
- **Cones**: color vision (high light), bigger
	- 3 types of cones (RGB), which are sensitive to different wavelengths of light

The **fovea** is an important and powerful area of the retina which is responsible for processing your central field of vision. The fovea contains only cones which are all densely packed, giving it high visual acuity.

The electro-chemical signals produced by the rods and cones in the retina are then passed through **ganglion cells**, which send the information through the optic nerve to the brain. Ganglion cells are just a specialized type of [[neurons]].

## retinotopic organization

Raw data from the outside world is transported through the optic nerve, where it gets to the LGN.
#### lateral geniculate nucleus
The LGN is a layered region located in the thalamus is the first stop for image processing, and is composed of **ganglion cells**. There are three types of ganglion cells:
- P-cells, which process shape
- M-cells, which process motion
- K-cells, which process color

Not all visual information goes to the LGN and visual pathway. Around 10% goes to the **superior colliculus** for *unconscious* processing. Information processed here is detected but we are not necessarily aware of it.

Cells in the LGN have [[receptive fields]] which are very similar to simple ganglion cells (ON center OFF surround, or vice versa).
## v1: the primary visual cortex
**Hubel & Weisel** discovered the existence of simple & complex cells in the visual cortex. These cells have their own [[receptive fields]].
- Simple Cells - _orientation detection_
- Complex Cells - _directionality of motion_

>[!tip] Retinotopy
>**Retinotopy** is the way visual information is mapped in the visual stream, and primarily the V1 cortex.

The V1 is composed of **columns** and **hypercolumns**. Following retinotopy, adjacent columns of the V1 analyze adjacent areas of the retinal image. These areas also follow [[cognitive architectures#localization|cortical magnification]], where the fovea is overrepresented in terms of the number of columns and hypercolumns dedicated to it (about the same amount as the entire rest of the retina).

After the V1, visual information is sent to the **extrastriate cortex**, which is comprised of cortices V2 to V5. In the **V2**, cells are specialized to detect simple features, such as orientation, spatial frequency, and color. Less is known about the **V3**, it is thought to split information to send to the ventral and dorsal pathways.
#### v4: ventral stream
_The “what” pathway_, in the inferior part of the temporal lobe is used for [[perception#object identification|object identification]].
- Achromatopsia - _brain can’t process color_
- Prosopagnosia - _brain can’t process faces_
#### v5: dorsal stream
_The “where” pathway_, located in the parietal lobe is used for locating, navigating to, and grasping objects. It also processes actions and movements.
- Akinetopsia: _motion blindness_
- Optic Ataxia - _deficit in reaching_

### david marr's computational theory of vision
Vision is an information processor, and our perception is created in the following steps:
1. Image - _raw data to be processed_
2. Primal Sketch - _feature abstraction_
3. 2D View
4. 3D View - _your view of the world_

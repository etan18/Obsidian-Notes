## eyeball structure
#### retina
The retina is a layer at the back of the eyeball that is lined with photoreceptors.

**Photoreceptors** use *transduction* to convert light into chemical or electrical signals. They eye contains two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones.
- **Rods:** scotopic vision (low light)
- **Cones**: color vision (high light)
The **fovea** is an important and powerful area of the retina which is responsible for processing your central field of vision. The fovea contains only cones which are all densely packed, giving it high visual acuity.

The electro-chemical signals produced by the rods and cones in the retina are then passed through **ganglion cells**, which send the information through the optic nerve to the brain. Ganglion cells are just a specialized type of [[neurons]].

## retinotopic organization
Raw data from the outside world is transported through the optic nerve, where it gets to the LGN.
#### lateral geniculate nucleus
The LGN located in the thalamus is the first stop for image processing, and is composed of **ganglion cells**. There are three types of ganglion cells:
- P-cells, which process shape
- M-cells, which process motion
- K-cells, which process color

Not all visual information goes to the LGN and visual pathway. Around 10% goes to the **superior colliculus** for *unconscious* processing. Information processed here is detected but we are not necessarily aware of it.

#### v1: the primary visual cortex
**Hubel & Weisel** discovered the existence of simple & complex cells in the visual cortex. These cells have their own [[receptive fields]].
- Simple Cells - _orientation detection_
- Complex Cells - _directionality of motion_

After the V1, visual information is sent to the **extrastriate cortex**, which is comprised of cortices V2 to V5. In the **V2**, cells are specialized to detect simple features, such as orientation, spatial frequency, and color. Less is known about the **V3**, it is thought to split information to send to the ventral and dorsal pathways.
#### v4: ventral stream
_The “what” pathway_
- Achromatopsia - _brain can’t process color_
- Prosopagnosia - _brain can’t process faces_
#### v5: dorsal stream
_The “where” pathway_
- Akinetopsia: _motion blindness_
- Optic Ataxia - _deficit in reaching_

### david marr's computational theory of vision
Vision is an information processor, and our perception is created in the following steps:
1. Image - _raw data to be processed_
2. Primal Sketch - _feature abstraction_
3. 2D View
4. 3D View - _your view of the world_

Brain waves are electrical currents in the brain which reflect neural activity. There are five primary types of brain waves, grouped by frequency:
- **Gamma**: >30Hz
- **Beta**: 13-30Hz
- **Alpha**: 8-12Hz
- **Theta**: 4-8Hz
- **Delta**: <4Hz
Brain waves can be measured using [[imaging#dynamic imaging techniques|EEGs]].
### brain stimulation
One common experimental method in [[cognitive neuroscience]] attempts to manipulate neural activity by stimulating the brain cells in targeted areas. There are three primary methods of non-invasive brain stimulation for humans:
1. **Transcranial magnetic stimulation** (TMS): giant capacitor
	- Animal studies show there are no lasting changes in cell viability even from high stimulation rates.
	- Used for treatment of depression (repeated stimulation of the prefrontal cortex)
2. **Transcranial electrical stimulation** (tES): low-intensity current applied to scalp changes the excitability of [[neurons]]. tES can only be applied at low currents to alter excitability. Higher currents would be unsafe and disruptive to healthy neural activity.
	- Anodal electrode: puts neurons closer to threshold (more excitable)
	- Cathodal electrode: puts neurons farther from threshold (less excitable)
	tES can be applied used direct current stimulation (tDCS) at a fixed current, or using alternating current stimulation (tACS) to boost endogenous oscillatory activity.
3. **Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation** (tFUS): uses sound waves at >20kHz, which produces mechanical vibrations which cause neural activation. This method is capable of targeting deep brain structures with precision, whereas TMS and tES are only used for treatment of superficial areas.

These methods transiently perturb brain function from the outside of the skull, where disruption has limited spatial and temporal effect. These methods differ in the medium which is used for stimulation (magnetic field, electrical current, sound waves). 


>[!note] Deep Brain Stimulation
>The most common form of invasive brain stimulation is **deep brain stimulation (DBS)**. It involves implanting electrodes into the brain to produce electrical impulses. The amount of stimulation is controlled by a pacemaker-like device placed under the skin in the upper chest. A wire that travels under the skin connects this device to the electrodes in the brain.

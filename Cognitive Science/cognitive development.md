## wilhelm preyer (1841-1897)
Wilhelm Preyer was an English-born psychologist and a pioneer of scientific child psychology. 
###### observational studies
Preyer established the first set of standards for developmental observational studies, which stipulated a
- Minumum of $3$ observations of the child per day 
- Observations must be verified by a second observer
- Observations must be recorded immediately
- Observers may not make special attempts to elicit specific behaviors
- No "training" of the child

Preyer's work employing observational methods focused on comparing children's behaviors to other species. From these studies, he found that **humans develop cognitive abilities and motor skills more slowly than other species**. Critically, this could indicate that that humans are more heavily influenced by environmental factors during their development.

## jean piaget (1896-1980)

#### piaget's theory of cognitive development
In 1936, Piaget proposed his now-famous Theory of Cognitive Development. It was a four-stage model of [[learning]] about their surrounding world.
###### 1. sensorimotor stage
The first stage, the sensorimotor stage, occurs from birth to around two years old and is characterized by the child's understanding of the world through sensory experiencesÂ and motor actions. During this time, the child also begins the development of [[language]] in its most basic form.

>[!tip] Object Permanance
> Piaget discovered that, in the sensorimotor stage, children will begin to understand **object permanance**. This is the understanding that items and people still exist even when they are not seen or heard.
###### 2. preoperational stage
The second stage, the preoperational stage, occurs from around two to seven years old and is characterized by the child's newfound ability to represent concepts through symbolic thinking and structured language (e.g. grammar and syntax).

>[!tip] Conservation
> In the preoperational stage, children additionally realize that properties of people and objects (e.g. mass, volume) remain the same even if the objects and people change form. These changes can include a cake being cut, a person dying their hair, and other superficial changes.

It's during this stage where the child's imagination and creativity become active.
###### 3. concrete operational stage
The third stage, the concrete operational stage, occurs from around seven to twelve years old and is characterized by the child's ability to think logically about concrete objects and events.

###### 4. formal operational stage
Finally, the fourth stage, the formal operational stage, occurs from around twelve years old and is characterized by the child's ability to think abstractly and reason hypothetically.

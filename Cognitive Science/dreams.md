The very broad definition of a *dream* is simply a report of mental activity upon awakening from [[sleep]], which frequently include
- Thoughts
- Hallucinations
- Episodic memory sources (*not* episodic memories themselves, rather abstractions which can be traced back to episodic memories)

Dreaming can occur from different stages of sleep, but the most vivid, hallucinatory dreams occur during [[sleep#rem|REM]] sleep. Dreams in earlier stages of sleep, such as sleep onset or NREM, include more episodic memory sources and directed thinking.

>[!note] How to Study Dreaming
>All studies of dreaming rely on verbal reports from participants. We can use these reports to find correlations with brain activity, stages of sleep, or stimuli presented before/during sleep.

>**Meta-analysis**: combine results from multiple sources (e.g. brain activity and verbal reports)

### why do we dream
Why dreaming, particularly hallucinatory REM dreams, occurs is a largely open problem that has been approached through philosophical, behavioral, and empirical perspectives. 

Dreaming may be **epiphenomenal**, meaning a byproduct of the primary purpose of REM sleep, without having much function on its own. However, dream studies do show a therapeutic or clinical benefit of dreaming, as it can help resolve traumatic memories.
##### dreaming to unlearn
In 1983, Francis Crick and Graeme Mitchison proposed the theory that the function of REM sleep is to "clean up" the memories formed during the day. They posited that this mechanism was necessary because the brain imprints a lot of irrelevant information that is not useful or efficient to store (called *parasitic memories*). 

However, there is little empirical evidence to support REM-sleep forgetting.

>[!tip] Sleep to Forget, Sleep to Remember
>Newer theories of dreaming during REM support that they are a form of **overnight therapy**, which has a role in managing mental health disorders like PTSD. The sleep-to-forget, sleep-to-remember (SFSR) hypothesis states that REM sleep helps forget the emotional tone of a [[memory]], while still preserving the content of the memory.
##### improving [[memory]]
Dreaming during either sleep onset or REM may allow for the consolidation of memories, particularly abstract information processing or formation of associations with existing memories. Particularly, studies show that the content of a dream determines how much functional benefit you get from dreaming:
- Participants were introduced to a maze-solving task and took a nap before solving the maze. Participants who saw maze elements in their dream had greater task improvement, creativity, and hyper-associative thought.
##### threat simulation theory
TST is the theory that dreams are a safe, offline environment to simulate potentially dangerous events, and is essentially a biological defense mechanism. TST is 
- Evolutionarily-guided, and presented as a selected trait for allowing "practice" via simulation
- Physiologically supported, as activity patterns of REM sleep are somewhat similar to those elicited by the presence of predators in animals

## what do they mean?

##### disguised censorship
Sigmund Freud is the father of **psychoanalysis**, and his work pioneered much of dream analysis. In his seminal work, *The Interpretation of Dreams*, published in 1900, Freud proposed 
the theory of **disguised censorship**â€”he believed that when we dream, we discharge the repressed wishes (latent content) that exist deep in our minds. 
- Freud believed that our dreams were filtered, or encrypted, versions of our raw and undisguised wishes, which he called the manifest content. He believed this happened as a protective measure, because the latent content would be too disturbing and wake us up.
- He claimed to have discovered the "decryption code" and could reverse engineer dreams to the core desire, and treat it. For money.

This theory of disguised censorship has been widely criticized, primarily because the hypothesis presented is not objectively testable. Moreover, different "dream analysts" produce different interpretations of the same dream, suggesting the subjectivity of dreams (Fosshage & Loew 1987).

However, because the theory also can't be disproven, its remained in the public memory in some shape or form even until today. 

#### hypnagogic images
Whether or not **dream manipulation** is possible has been a long-standing question. That is, can we control or influence what we dream about? While the answer is probably no, studies have found that what we experience in [[sleep#N1|hypnagogic states]] *is* influenced by what we learn and experience throughout the day.

**Experimental design from (*Stickgold et al., 2000*)**: 
Subjects from three groups play 7 hours of Tetris over three days:
1. novices with no prior Tetris experience
2. experts with significant Tetris experience
3. amnesic patients whose hippocampus has been removed to treat epilepsy
Subjects were repetitively woken up just after falling asleep and asked to recall what they saw in their hypnagogic dreams.
- Novices experienced some element of Tetris in their dream at the highest rates (~70%, compared to ~50% in experts). The *novelty* of formed experiences is thus a factor in determining what we dream about.
- Amnesia group rate was ~60%, meaning that hypnagogic dreams do not come from classical memory store (hippocampus), and must be generated from elsewhere in the brain.
- Participant experiences were *not episodic*, meaning they were not replays of the games they actually played. Instead, they distilled the salient aspects of the game (e.g. pieced falling or rotating)

**Dream lag effect** is the observed phenomenon that episodic memories from waking life are sometimes incorporated into REM dreams, especially about 5-7 nights after the event.

## lucid dreaming
Lucid dreaming is the experience of becoming aware that you are dreaming during the act of dreaming itself. Well practiced lucid dreamers can even control what or how they dream.
- Physiologically, lucid dreamers have fast (40hz) EEG activity in their pre-frontal cortex during REM, just like we do when we're awake. Typically during non-lucid REM sleep, prefrontal fast EEG activity is absent.
- When lucid dreaming a motor action (e.g. hand clenching), the corresponding fMRI activations mirror the activations of physically performing the action while awake (Dresler et al. 2011)

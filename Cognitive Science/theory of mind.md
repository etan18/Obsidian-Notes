The brain is a material, physical thing that can be examined and studied empirically. The mind consists of subjective phenomena such as thoughts, feelings, and beliefs. The **mind-body problem** aims to discover the relationship between the two.

There are two primary viewpoints on the mind-body problem, monism and dualism.
### monism
Also known as **physicalism**, monism believes that cognition is produced by physical entities (the brain) alone. This viewpoint was championed by Aristotle, as well as pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Thales, who claimed every event must have a natural cause.

Within physicalism, there are multiple sects. For example, **philosophical behaviorism** views mental states as having predisposed behaviors. Mental states are essentially input-output functions unique to an individual.
- For example, to have [[preferences]] is to be predisposed to engage in behaviors that lean towards our specific interest.
- Having beliefs just means we’re disposed to actions that convey a certain belief

**Functionalism** is another physicalist view that mental states work together in a system, where the present mental state is determined by sensory inputs and causes certain behaviors. For example, facing bodily damage causes us to be in the “pain” mental state and causes precautionary behaviors.

Eliminativism is a radical form of physicalism that believes that mental states—including beliefs, desires, and conscious experiences—simply do not exist!

**Identity theory**, also known as Physical State Theory, states that mental states are brain states. Formally, this theory states that each mental state maps to a unique physical state in the brain. For example, experiencing pain is identical with synchronized firing in the somatosensory cortex.
- **Type Identity Theory**: every type of mental event is identical with a type of physical event. Types of events can be universally experienced (e.g. leg pain)
- **Token Identity Theory**: every token mental event is identical with some token mental event (there could be infinitely many token events)
### dualism
The body is material, but the mind is non-material and thus does not adhere to the laws of nature. The two can interact and influence one another.
	- Plato & Descartes, who believed the two were linked by "the passions of the soul"

>If $X$ and $Y$ are the same object, then they have all the same properties. If $X$ and $Y$ differ in just one property, then they cannot possibly be the same object. This law can be used to argue in favor of dualism by identifying a property where the mind and body differ. For example, the mind is capable of thought whereas the body is not.

Ibn Sina (980-1037 AD), known in the western world as Avicenna, is the most influential philosopher of the Islamic Golden Age. His **"Flying Man"** thought experiment suppposes that if God created a person in midair, with his sight veiled, limbs outstretched so that he is touching nothing, and with no memories, this person will still be aware of their own existence, even without knowing his body exists. This experiment became a foundational argument in favor of dualism.

- **Dual Aspect Theory**: The brain is the seat of consciousness, but the conscious states within it are not purely physical.
- **Property Dualism**: Mental properties belong to physical objects (bodies, brains), but they themselves are not physical entities.
- **Substance Dualism**: Famously defended by Rene Descartes, radical dualist view that believes the mind can exist outside the body, and the body cannot think.

### other perspectives
- **Panpsychism**: All things have a mind or mind-like quality
- **Minimal Physicalism**: Mental properties supervene on physical properties.

Generally speaking, **aphasia** refers to the impairment of [[language]]. There are many different types of aphasia corresponding to various causes and presentations of impairment.

**Primary progressive aphasia** (PPA) is a blanket term for conditions which slowly damage or deteriorate parts of the brain that control speech and language.
### logopenia
Patients exhibiting Logopenic Variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA) have increasing difficulty thinking of the words they want to say.
- Causes of logopenia are currently unknown, although lvPPA patients typically have a buildup of specific proteins in the brain, which are the same as those seen in Alzheimer's patients

### non-fluency
Nonfluent Variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (nvfPPA) involves increasing difficulty with producing speech. Their speech may sound slurred, or their voice may change. As time goes on, people with nfvPPA have more trouble putting sentences together, and they eventually begin to speak slower and slower.

### semantics
People with Semantic Variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (svPPA) have increasing difficulty understanding the *meaning* of words, including finding words and naming people and objects.
- Commonly, we will see patients using more general names for specific things.
- svPPA is considered a subtype of a larger group of brain conditions called [frontotemporal dementia](https://memory.ucsf.edu/frontotemporal-dementia) (FTD)

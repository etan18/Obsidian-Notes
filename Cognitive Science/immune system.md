### innate immune system
The **innate immune system** is the body's first line of defense against pathogens and harmful invaders. It is non-specific, meaning it targets a wide range of pathogens without requiring prior exposure.

Some key components of the innate immune system include
1. **Skin & mucous membranes**: acts as a physical barrier which prevents the entry of pathogens
2. **Phagocytes**: e.g. macrophages and neutrophils, which engulf and destroy pathogens
3. **Inflammatory response**: triggered when tissues are damaged or infected, leading to redness, heat, swelling, and pain. This recruits immune cells to the site of infection or injury.


>[!info] The Immune Response
>When the immune system detects a pathogen, it initiates an immune response, which is a coordinated effort to eliminate the threat. This response begins with the innate immune system's rapid actions, and if the pathogen persists, the **adaptive immune system** is activated to provide a more targeted and long-lasting defense.

**Cytokines** act as messengers for the immune system. They are secreted by various immune cells and help coordinate the body's defense by promoting inflammation, recruiting immune cells to infection sites, and regulating the activity of immune cells.
### sleep and immune function
Certain cytokines, like **TNF-alpha**, are involving in promoting [[sleep]]. 

- One study found that sleep deprived subjects (< 4 hrs/night for at least 4 nights straight) who received the flu shot produced less than half the antibody response compared to well-rested subjects. Even after correcting their sleep schedule, the antibody levels never recovered to match the control group response. 
- Another study found that the glucose tolerance, or rate at which glucose was able to be cleared from blood, was impaired by over 40% in sleep-deprived subjects (< 4 hrs/night for at least 5 nights). These rates were on par with pre-diabetes.
- Sleep deprivation can also cause significant declines in the activity of natural killer (NK) cells, which are a crucial part of your innate immune system. This makes you more susceptible to infections and cancers.

### metabolism
**Leptin** is a hormone that inhibits appetite and increases energy expenditure, so it causes you to not want to eat. In contrast, **ghrelin** is a hormone which increases appetite and inhibits energy expenditure, thus causing you to want to eat.

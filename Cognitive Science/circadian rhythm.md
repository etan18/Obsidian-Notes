Etymologically, a **circadian rhythm** just means a cycle that repeats approximately every 24 hours (*circa* = about, *dias* = day). With respect to physiology and [[sleep]], we typically refer to the endogenous circadian rhythm (*endogenous* = originating from the body).  Every single living species shows a 24 hour circadian rhythm.

Circadian rhythms regulate
- Our sleep/wake cycle
- Hormone release
- Our eating/drinking habits
- Body temperature
- Urine volume

>[!important] The Master Clock
>The so-called "clock" that dictates our circadian rhythm is the **suprachiasmatic nucleus** (SCN), located in the hypothalamus of the brain. There are also peripheral clocks in various other organs and tissues. These are what make circadian rhythms *endogenous*, or internally generated.

How does the circadian rhythm express itself physiologically? There are a few cyclical phenomena that we can observe.
1. **Body temperature**: reaches its daily high about 6 hours before sleep onset, and daily low about 2 hours after sleep onset
2. **Melatonin secretion**: begins about 2 hours before sleep onset, remains high across the night and is suppressed during the day
	1. Released in response to darkness

### zeitgebers
**Zeitgebers** (German for *time givers*) are any stimuli that can reset or calibrate the circadian rhythm to be about 24 hours. Light, or specifically daylight, is the most important zeitgeber because the sun is such a reliable 24-hour signal. There are other zeitgebers, such as
- food
- socializing
- physical activity
Zeitgebers are capable of synchronizing the SCN (master clock) with other peripheral clocks in other organs for optimal brain-body coordination.
###### mammoth cave study (1938)
Tested the hypothesis that the circadian rhythm was controlled by daylight. Kleitman and Richardson lived in Mammoth Cave for 6 weeks straight (darkness). 
- Found that the cycle of a human circadian rhythm gets longer in the absence of external cues---like daylight---which are what typically calibrate the 24-hour period
	- Richardson developed a 26-28 hour rhythm, with a 9hr sleep cycle
	- Kleitman's circadian rhythm did not meaningfully change
- The human circadian clock cycle is slightly longer than 24 hours in the absence of an external zeitgeber (current estimate is around 24hrs 10mins)

##### innate preferences
The development of taste preferences begins ********in utero.******** Fetuses have an innate preference towards the taste of break milk and amniotic fluids. The taste of both are influenced by the mother’s diet and environment.

Additionally, there is an innate human instinct towards nutrient-rich, high-calorie, high-protein foods. This displays itself as a preference to sweet or umami flavors. There are also aversions to bitter and sour flavors, which may reflect protective adaptations against poisons and toxins.

### learned preferences
As we get older, it is possible—and in fact, expected—that we deviate from these innate preferences. These learned preferences are shaped by our environments, including various factors such as
-   Food availability
-   Repeated exposure to averse foods in positive situations
-   Peer pressure

##### familiarity vs. novelty
The complexity of a stimulus depends on context; it could be anything from its information content to its ********new-ness******** in relation to the infant.

**It was found that infants are drawn to either extremely familiar or extremely novel stimuli.**
>[!note] Surprisal
>In [[entropy]], surprisal quantifies the amount of uncertainty that some random variable X takes on value x given the priors.

Formalizing the familiarity vs. novelty theorem above, we can observe selective attention in infants for events with intermediate surprisal (Kidd et al, 2010).

##### eyetracking
The primary method for measuring infant attention or visual preferences is through *eyetracking*.

**pros**
-   Improved spatial and temporal accuracy compared to other gaze-based methods
-   Allows for contingent designs
-   For developmental research, works on verbal and non-verbal children

**cons**
-   Easy to confound spatial and temporal patterns
-   Incompatible with young infants who can’t raise their head

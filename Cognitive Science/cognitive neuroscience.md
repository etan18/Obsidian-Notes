Cognitive neuroscience is the study of "how the brain enables thought". 
- Cognition: the process of "knowing" or "thinking", encompassing [[perception]], reasoning, [[consciousness]]
- Neuroscience: the organization and function of the nervous system

This field uses empirical scientific methods applied to the brain to inquire about the intangible mind. This setup takes a [[theory of mind#monism|physicalist]] view on the theory of mind.

#### neuroanatomical methods
**Cytoarchitectonics** looks at the structural organization of cells by examining stained tissue under a microscope to identify different layers and cell types. This method was employed to distinguish the **Brodmann areas** (early 20th century), a mapping of the brain into 52 distinct regions based on the density, arrangement, and types of [[neurons]] present in that region.
- Density was originally measured using **Nissl staining** (stains the cell bodies only)
- Provided a standardized reference system for the cerebral cortex
- Areas can be linked to [[cognitive architectures#localization|localized]] functions, including BA 17 (primary [[visual cortex]]) and BA 4 (primary motor cortex) 

**Projection maps** look to create "wiring diagrams" between regions of the brain to map connectivity. They are constructed by staining neurons to visualize the connection of cells:
- Golgi staining: absorbed by the cells and spreads to neighboring cells, though dye only absorbed by about 1 in every 100 cells
- HRP: dye is picked up by the axon and travels backward into the soma (retrograde tracing)
Polysynaptic tracing can be done by injecting modified rabies or herpes viruses into the brain to map multi-order neural circuits that cross multiple synapses.

#### physiological methods
Neural stimulation is a method of manually modulating action potentials in the brain. 
- Direct cortical stimulation: electrical (current) signals
- Optogenetics: genetically modify cells by injecting light-sensitive proteins, control and measure activity with high spatial and temporal precision by introducing or removing light
- Single-cell recordings: record activity of neurons to determine response properties in specific regions (used to map [[receptive fields]])

Neuropixel probes (microlevel mapping)
Human connectome (macrolevel mapping)

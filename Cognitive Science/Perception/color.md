What we perceive as different colors really just represents the range of wavelengths which are visible to the human eye, or the **visible light spectrum**. Different organisms are sensitive to different wavelengths.

The exact color we perceive is dependent on the reflectance of the surface we are looking at and the illumination of the [[perception#light & shadow|light]] surface.

### tri-chromatic theory
Tri-chromatic theory is the predominantly-accepted notion for how color is encoded in the brain. It was proposed by Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz in the 19th century.

The theory posits that there are three different types of [[visual cortex#photoreceptors|cones]], where each type is broadly tuned to a different, specific wavelength (red, blue, and green). Any color visible to humans can be formed by combining different RBG amounts.

>[!tip] Metamers
>Because the brain would only measure 3 values under this theory, and there are infinitely many images which could produce the same 3 RBG values, color is **non-invertible**. This means we could not recover the real-world image from just the three measured RBG values. These images are **metamers**.

Tri-chromatic theory has been widely used in electronics like TVs and monitors. Its simplicity in only requiring three values to represent the entire color spectrum makes it particularly appealing in these applications.

### opponent color processing
This theory, which addresses shortcomings of tri-chromatic theory, was presented by Ewald Hering. It posits that primary colors are actually organized in pairs of **opponent colors**:
- Red <-> Green: chromatically opponent
- Blue <-> Yellow: chromatically opponent
- Black <-> White: spatially opponent
Opponent color processing explains some **afterimage** phenomena. Color opponency takes the tri-chromatic information measure by the cones and processes the opponent pairs at the [[receptive fields#ganglion cells|ganglion cell]] level.

>[!danger] Color Blindness
>Color blindness typically arises from loss of either red or green cones in the retina. It's extremely rare to lose blue cones.

>Cortical color blindness is total loss of the subject experience of color (black & white vision) caused by damage to the V8 of the brain.

We see objects because they reflect light. Light reflects in all possible directions from each point that it touches. Because of this, any pattern describing the object which the light is reflecting off of is lost. The question now becomes: **how can we recover the pattern?**

>[!info] Light
>There are a few key properties of light. First, light is an *electromagnetic wave*, where its wavelength determines how we perceive it (i.e. what color it is, if it lies within the visible light range). Second, light rays travel in a straight line; this property allows us to manipulate and filter light using the techniques described below.

## pinholes
Ibn Al-Haitham is the mathematician who invented the pinhole camera (camera obscura) between the 10th and 11th century. 

Pinholes filter out light rays that don't originate from a specific direction. This makes it such that only one ray of light from each point on the object will pass through the pinhole camera, thus allowing us to recreate the image on the screen which these rays are projects upon.

There are problems with the image produced by pinholes:
- Resulant projection is inverted (upside-down)
- The image is scaled (bigger or smaller) depending on the distance of the projection screen from the pinhole
- The main problem, though, is that because the pinhole is filtering out the vast majority of light rays, the resultant image is extremely *dim*.
To fix this problem of dimness and allow more light to pass onto the projection, we use lenses.
## lenses
When light passes through different materials, its movement changes. A converging lens employs **refraction** to bend light rays such that they are focused onto a single point. 

The distance from the lens at which all the rays converge is the **focal length** $f$. The shorter the focal length, the more powerful the lens. 
$$\text{lens power} = \text{refractive index} = \frac{1}{f}$$
The unit of lens power is *diopters*.

Reflections must be
- Lighter than the surface they're seen on
- Vertically aligned if reflecting on a horizontal surface, and vice versa
- Natural (i.e. following the curvature of the object, not random)
Reflections do not need to have the 
- Right content
	- For humans to still perceive something as a reflection, it does not necessarily need to follow the laws of physics.
- Shining everywhere

Some very simple organisms which do not have eyes use only [[visual cortex#photoreceptors|photoreceptors]] to perceive light information. 
- Amoeba and paramecium can only know to move away from or toward light, respectively. 
- Limpits (flatworm patella) have an array of photoreceptors which each point in different directions, allowing it to isolate the direction of a light source. This operates like a very poor pinhole camera.
### compound eyes
Many lenses, in a lot of cases lenses are mapped 1-to-1 with a single photoreceptor.
- Operate like *tubes*
- Very good for temporal resolution, but much harder to achieve human-like spatial resolution

### simple eyes
One lens, many receptors. Humans have simple eyes.

The techniques described on this page let us know how to manipulate light to recover images. For vision, however, that's only the first step. The question now becomes: "*what do we do with the image?*"

To answer this question, we move to the [[visual cortex]].

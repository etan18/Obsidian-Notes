The *form* in which information is stored in the brain is one of the fundamental and most long-standing questions in cognition.

In the 1950s, Karl Lashley led the scientific search for the **engram**, the physical location of memory storage in the brain. As we know today, the engram does not exist, and memory behaves more like [[distributed systems]] across regions of our brain.

## case studies

**H.M.’s Hippocampus**
In 1953, Henry Molaison had his hippocampus removed in an attempt to cure his epilepsy.
-   Damage/removal of the hippocampus resulted in **anterograde amnesia**, an inability to retain new information or create new memories
-   Concluded that _memory consolidation_, or the process of encoding short term memory to long term memory, occurs in the hippocampus
In comparison to anterograde amnesia, **retrograde amnesia** is the inability to retrieve existing information and memories.

**Kim Peek**
Kim Peek was born without a *corpus callosum*, which caused him to have *Savant Syndrome*, a phenomenon that gives people with mental disabilities extraordinary abilities on specific tasks. Peek had an unlimited memory.

This was due to the fact that his brain adapted and learned typically cross-hemisphere tasks, like [[language]], independently in *both* hemispheres of his brain.

## models of memory

##### the multimodal approach, by atkins & shiffrin
The multimodal approach breaks down memory into 3 areas. 
###### sensory memory
Stimulus input is initially **sensory memory**. 
    1.  *Iconic Memory* — persistence of a visual image
    2.  *Echoic Memory* — persistence of auditory memory

One prevalent theory suggests that sensory information is stored as **encoded representations** in the brain, where each memory has a unique mapping to some pattern of stimulation in the brain. This theory is an oversimplification, and also suggests that if we were to have access to the "wiring diagram" of the brain, we would be able to recover the sensory information that is currently being perceived.

Finally, the most complex explanation is based in **Hebbian [[Learning]]**. 
###### short term memory
The next phase of memory is **short term memory**, or working memory. 
    1.  Limited duration (a few seconds), but can be lengthened by
        1.  *Chunking* — grouping related items
        2.  *Rehearsal* — repetition of an item

>[!tip] Miller's Law
>Miller's Law states that the average person's working memory can only store 7 pieces of information at any given time. It is for this reason that chunking is a helpful tool used in things like UI/UX design, driven by [[gestalt principles]].

###### long term memory
Finally, information deemed important is encoded into **long term memory**. There are two types of LTM: declarative and procedural memory.
	1.  *Declarative Memory* — symbolically encoded information
	    1.  *Semantic Memory* — meaning, understanding, and conceptual facts about the world
	        1.  Limbic Cortex
	    2.  *Episodic Memory* — past experiences
	        1.  Hippocampus
	2.  *Procedural Memory* — performance of tasks and skills
	    1.  Basal Ganglia and Motor Cortex

*Gestaltism* is a theory of [[perception]] which emphasizes the processing of patterns and configurations instead of plain objects and components. It provides an objective framework for modern day design.

The Gestalt Laws of Grouping, or **Gestalt principles**, state that we identify surfaces based on the probability that certain "bits" belong together in real scenes. These probabilities are assigned automatically by our brains based on many features, which are the various principles.

---
### proximity
We see objects that are close to each other as more related than objects that are far apart. Visually, distance defines relatedness.

### closure
Objects are bounded volumes which must have closed outer contours. This assumption that our brain makes allows us to fill in images with missing data to form complete expected patterns.

### similarity
On average, there is higher similarity of material within an object than between a part of the object and its surroundings. This means that elements with similar characteristics are perceived to be more closely related than elements which are vastly different.

### continuity
Typically, object boundaries are smooth. 

### perception
Within Gestaltism, *perception* refers to the natural tendency for people to perceive relationships between objects in an image as either figure (focal point) or ground (background).

When several objects are juxtaposed, we naturally create a sense of spatial relationships between them, even in the absence of overt visual cues.

### organization
This Gestalt principle of organization defines characteristics of object relationships which shape our perception of them. 
- **Uniform connectedness**: objects that are visually connected are more closely related
- **Common regions**: elements are perceived to be part of a group when they share an area with a clearly defined boundary
- **Synchrony**: elements that are moving in the same direction are perceived to be more closely related than ones that are stationary or moving in opposite directions.
- **Parallelism**: parallel elements are more closely related than non-parallel ones.
- **Focal points**: points of interest, emphasis, and contrast capture and hold our attention
			*"If everything is emphasized, nothing is."*
### symmetry
Symmetrical elements are perceived to be part of a unified group.

**Neurons** are the fundamental cell which make up our nervous system. They are responsible for receiving and relaying sensory inputs.

### cell anatomy
There are three main parts of the neuron: cell body, dendrites, and the synapse.
- The **soma**, or cell body
	- The nucleus of the cell, and other organelles, are stored in the soma
- **Dendrites** are small arms which receive external information and pass it into the cell
- The **axon** is the long arm of the neuron which fires, transmitting an electrical signal if the *action potential* is reached

#### action potential
There are two types of synaptic input: **excitatory** and **inhibitory**. 
- **epsp**: Excitatory post-synaptic potential which *depolarizes* the cell and makes the neuron more likely to fire. Depolarizing means the cell becomes less negative (more positive).
- **ipsp**: Inhibitory post-synaptic potential which *hyperpolarizes* the cell and makes the neuron less likely to fire. Hyperpolarizing means the cell becomes more negative.

If enough excitatory post-synaptic potential is received by the cell, then the cell will observe **action potential**. The action potential is triggered on all all-or-nothing basis: if the synaptic potential exceeds the threshold, then action potential is observed; otherwise, there is no action potential.

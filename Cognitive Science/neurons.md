The **neuron doctrine** (Ramon y Cajal, 1852-1934) is the base principle that **neurons** are the fundamental unit of the nervous system. These cells are responsible for receiving and relaying sensory inputs.

The form, interconnectivity, and arrangement of neurons varies depending on the location of the neurons, and these qualities relate to the functions of specific neurons.
### cell anatomy
There are three main parts of the neuron: cell body, dendrites, and the synapse.
- The **soma**, or cell body
	- The nucleus of the cell, and other organelles, are stored in the soma
- **Dendrites** are small arms which receive external information and pass it into the cell
	- The **spines** are specialized protrusions from dendrites where the information is actually received
	- Dendritic arborization is the branching of the dendrites of a neuron to form a synapse. Some dendritic arbors, such as those in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, can be vast and complex while others are more simple.
- The **axon** is the long arm of the neuron which fires, transmitting an electrical signal if the *action potential* is reached
	- The **axon hillock** is the region of the soma which connects to the axon and is where action potentials trigger

### neuronal signaling
Two neurons meet at the **synapse**, which is where the inter-neuronal communication occurs. Some axons branch to form **axon collaterals** which can transmit signals to more than one cell. Synapses can form between neurons, or from a neuron to non-neuronal cells such as muscle, glands, or blood vessels.
#### action potential
At rest, the inside of the cell is more negatively charged (around -70mV) relative to the outside of the cell, containing a higher concentration of potassium (K-) ions. 

The **action potential** is triggered on all all-or-nothing basis: if the synaptic potential exceeds the threshold (around -40 mV), then action potential is observed; otherwise, there is no action potential. Once this happens, membrane gates allow an inflow of positively-charge sodium ions (Na+) to increase the potential to around +50mV.

There are two types of synaptic input: **excitatory** and **inhibitory**, determined by the neurotransmitter:
- **epsp**: Excitatory post-synaptic potential which *depolarizes* the cell and makes the neuron more likely to fire. Depolarizing means the cell becomes less negative (more positive).
- **ipsp**: Inhibitory post-synaptic potential which *hyperpolarizes* the cell and makes the neuron less likely to fire. Hyperpolarizing means the cell becomes more negative.
The sum of excitatory and inhibitory input received by a postsynaptic neuron determines its **spike frequency**.

When no synaptic input is observed, or the excitatory and inhibitory inputs cancel each other out, then the neuron will sill observe **spontaneous activity**, which is just the firing of the neuron at random times
- If enough excitatory post-synaptic potential is received by the cell, then the cell will observe more action potentials than just the spontaneous activity.
- If enough inhibitory post-synaptic potential is received, the cell will observe less action potentials, and if only ipsp is observed, the neuron will be suppressed altogether and exhibit no action potentials.

## exocytosis
Voltage-gated calcium ion channels at the axon terminal open in response to the axon potential, allowing an influx of Ca2+ ions. This enables **exocytosis**, which causes the release of vesicles containing neurotransmitters.
#### neurotransmitters
The exact "message" that is sent through the synapse when neurons fire is determined by the neurotransmitter. 
- Specific dendrites are coded to receive specific neurotransmitters
- Reuptake: receptors at presynaptic terminal also bind to neurotransmitter to clean up and reuse the chemicals

There are over 100 different known neurotransmitters among mammalian brains. In general, most neurons contain only one transmitter type at the axon terminal, but can have multiple receptor types.
- Glutamate is the most common neurotransmitter in the brain
- GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter
Enzymes in the synaptic cleft regulate neurotransmitter activity by breaking them down into smaller molecules, called degradation.

## glial cells
Glial cells provide support for neurons. The **myelin sheath** insulates the axon, which serves to protect and strengthen the signal. These make up ~76% of glial cells.
- **Oligodendroglia**: makes up myelin in the CNS
- **Schwann Cells**: makes up myelin in the PNS
The resulting myelin formed by the concentration of cell membranes around the axon is a fatty tissue which acts as an electrical insulator, preventing loss of electrical current and thus causing better propagation as the signal travels down the axon.

**Astrocytes —** star-shaped cells that provide physical and nutritional support (~17%)
- Make contact with blood vessels via *end feet*, transporting ions across vascular wall
- Creates the **blood brain barrier** between the CNS and blood, protecting the brain from certain chemicals
- Astrocytes also moderate the re-uptake of neurotransmitters
**Microglia —** digest parts of dead neurons (~7%)
- Hyperactive microglial cells are thought to be an important contributor to the onset of Alzheimer’s

>[!tip] Einstein's Brain
>Einstein’s Brain was found to possess more glial cells than the average human brain. He also had an enlarged right parietal region, which is used for spatial and numerical processing, suggesting that Einstein was more of a visual learner. Finally, he had an enlarged corpus callosum, which would also suggest more communication between the left and right hemispheres.

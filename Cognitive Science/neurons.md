The neuron doctrine is the base principle that **neurons** are the fundamental unit of the nervous system. These cells are responsible for receiving and relaying sensory inputs.
### cell anatomy
There are three main parts of the neuron: cell body, dendrites, and the synapse.
- The **soma**, or cell body
	- The nucleus of the cell, and other organelles, are stored in the soma
- **Dendrites** are small arms which receive external information and pass it into the cell
- The **axon** is the long arm of the neuron which fires, transmitting an electrical signal if the *action potential* is reached

### action potential
The action potential is triggered on all all-or-nothing basis: if the synaptic potential exceeds the threshold, then action potential is observed; otherwise, there is no action potential.

There are two types of synaptic input: **excitatory** and **inhibitory**. 
- **epsp**: Excitatory post-synaptic potential which *depolarizes* the cell and makes the neuron more likely to fire. Depolarizing means the cell becomes less negative (more positive).
- **ipsp**: Inhibitory post-synaptic potential which *hyperpolarizes* the cell and makes the neuron less likely to fire. Hyperpolarizing means the cell becomes more negative.
The sum of excitatory and inhibitory input received by a neuron determines its **spike frequency**.

When no synaptic input is observed, or the excitatory and inhibitory inputs cancel each other out, then the neuron will sill observe **spontaneous activity**, which is just the firing of the neuron at random times
- If enough excitatory post-synaptic potential is received by the cell, then the cell will observe more action potentials than just the spontaneous activity.
- If enough inhibitory post-synaptic potential is received, the cell will observe less action potentials, and if only ipsp is observed, the neuron will be suppressed altogether and exhibit no action potentials.


### glial cells
Glial cells provide support for neurons. The **myelin sheath** insulates the axon, which serves to protect and strengthen the signal. These make up ~76% of glial cells.
- **Oligodendroglia**: makes up myelin in the CNS
- **Schwann Cells**: makes up myelin in the PNS

**Astrocytes —** star-shaped cells that provide physical and nutritional support (~17%)
**Microglia —** digest parts of dead neurons (~7%)
- Hyperactive microglial cells are thought to be an important contributor to the onset of Alzheimer’s

>[!tip] Einstein's Brain
>Einstein’s Brain was found to possess more glial cells than the average human brain. He also had an enlarged right parietal region, which is used for spatial and numerical processing, suggesting that Einstein was more of a visual learner. Finally, he had an enlarged corpus callosum, which would also suggest more communication between the left and right hemispheres.

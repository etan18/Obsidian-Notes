*Consciousness* is defined as the subjective quality of mental states. Anatomically, the thalamus is thought to be important for human consciousness.

###### the 40 hertz hypothesis
Consciousness is synchronized waves of neuronal firing at a frequency of 40 times per second in gamma waves, starting at the thalamus and moving from the front to the back of the brain

###### emergent property
Consciousness is not focused in a component or part of the brain, rather it is the result of a complex system.

### mechanisms of consciousness
**Biological Mechanisms**
-   Coma, concussions, and fainting all relate to head injury and cause loss of consciousness, suggesting that consciousness is neurological
-   Consciousness stops when the cellular processes of energy metabolism cease

**Electrical Mechanisms**
-   Epilepsy and epileptic seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which also cause loss of consciousness
-   Electrical signals also change during sleep, a period of loss of consciousness

**Chemical Mechanisms**
-   The neurotransmitter adenosine promotes sleep and decreased wakefulness
-   Chemicals like caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist, promotes wakefulness

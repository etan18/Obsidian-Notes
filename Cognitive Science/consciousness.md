*Consciousness* is defined as the subjective quality of mental states. This is the critical property of human beings that separates us from all other living species known to man.

Anatomically, the thalamus is thought to be important for human consciousness.

>[!note] the 40 hertz hypothesis
Consciousness is synchronized waves of neuronal firing at a frequency of 40 times per second in gamma waves, starting at the thalamus and moving from the front to the back of the brain

>[!note] emergent property
Consciousness is not focused in a component or part of the brain, rather it is the result of a complex system.

### mechanisms of consciousness
**Biological Mechanisms**
-   Coma, concussions, and fainting all relate to head injury and cause loss of consciousness, suggesting that consciousness is neurological
-   Consciousness stops when the cellular processes of energy metabolism cease

**Electrical Mechanisms**
-   Epilepsy and epileptic seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which also cause loss of consciousness
-   Electrical signals also change during sleep, a period of loss of consciousness

**Chemical Mechanisms**
-   The neurotransmitter adenosine promotes sleep and decreased wakefulness
-   Chemicals like caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist, promotes wakefulness

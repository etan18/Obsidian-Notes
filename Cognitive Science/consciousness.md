*Consciousness* is defined as the subjective quality of mental states. This is the critical property of human beings that separates us from all other living species known to man.

Anatomically, the thalamus is thought to be important for human consciousness.
>[!note] the 40 hertz hypothesis
Consciousness is synchronized waves of neuronal firing at a frequency of 40 times per second in gamma waves, starting at the thalamus and moving from the front to the back of the brain

>[!note] emergent property
Consciousness is not focused in a component or part of the brain, rather it is the result of a complex system.

## philosophies
##### rationalism
Rationalism grew out of the Enlightenment (1685 - 1815) that all knowledge could be gained through reason alone---truth is intellectual, not sensory. Fundamental concepts like math and God could be grasped through innate understanding, with all else able to be *reasoned* upon from these base principles.

Rene Descartes' famous quote "I think, therefore I am" ("**Cogito, ergo sum**") is a rationalist argument that knowledge of self-awareness does not require empirical evidence, it is just *known*.
##### empiricism
Empiricism is the viewpoint that knowledge stems from sensory experience, and the brain begins life as a blank slate.

**Associationism** views mental processes as built upon one another through experience. Psychological associationists believe that the aggregate of a person's experience determines the course of their mental development. This is a core component of empiricism, but also became a cornerstone of the study of [[behaviorism]].
### mechanisms of consciousness
**Biological Mechanisms**
-   Coma, concussions, and fainting all relate to head injury and cause loss of consciousness, suggesting that consciousness is neurological
-   Consciousness stops when the cellular processes of energy metabolism cease

**Electrical Mechanisms**
-   Epilepsy and epileptic seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which also cause loss of consciousness
-   Electrical signals also change during sleep, a period of loss of consciousness

**Chemical Mechanisms**
-   The neurotransmitter adenosine promotes sleep and decreased wakefulness
-   Chemicals like caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist, promotes wakefulness

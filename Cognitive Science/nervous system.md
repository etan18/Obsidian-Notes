The nervous system is comprised of two types of cells: [[neurons]] and [[neurons#glial cells|glial cells]]. There are an estimated 100B neurons in the nervous system, and a similar number of glial cells.

The nervous system uses electrochemical stimulation for communication.
- The [[neurons#action potential|action potential]] is a chemical process of transmission for synaptic action

The **central nervous system** (CNS) consists of the brain and spinal cord and is the body's primary control center for information processing and planning.


**Neuroplasticity** is the ability of the nervous system to reorganize its structure to reorganize its structure, functions, and connections in response to stimuli, such as [[learning]] or injury. 
- Synaptic plasticity: shaping of dendritic arbor (pruning, adding), thickening of myelin, expansion of astrocyte coverage in response to high/low rates of firing

>[!info] Dendritic Pruning
>The dendritic branches of a neuron change throughout its lifecycle. New arms may be added, while more commonly, branches may be deleted/pruned, with remaining branches becoming visibly thicker as the organism matures. This may be an [[representation learning|efficient coding]] strategy learned from patterns of firing.

**Neurogenesis** is the process of creating new neurons from stem cells. It has been observed in insects, fish, and birds. 21st century neuroscience research methods have uncovered neurogenesis in humans, most prominently in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb.
- **Stem cells**: early-stage cells which have not developed a specialization or cell type yet
- GPLD1 is an enzyme found in serum (blood) that has also been [linked](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7879650/) to promoting neurogenesis

## anatomy of the brain
The brain, or **cerebral cortex**, is organized in two hemispheres (left and right), and contains four main lobes.
- **Frontal**: houses the primary motor cortex
- **Parietal**
- **Occipital**
- **Temporal**

A nerve is a bundle, or collection of axons, usually with similar functions.

The **cortex** is the outer layer of the cerebral cortex. It is made up of **grey matter**, which is the collection of soma, or cell bodies, of the neurons in the brain. Visually, the outer layer is made up of a series of folds: 
- Superficial areas are called **gyri**
- Deep folds are called **sulci**. The central sulcus separates the frontal and parietal lobe. p
- Large sulci are called **fissures**
These folds developed evolutionarily to maximize the surface area of the brain in a fixed volume skull.

The inside of the brain is made up of **white matter**, containing all the axons of the neurons which are interacting with each other. The white appearance comes from the presence of glial cells supporting the propagation of neural signals.

The **limbic system** is the set of brain structures involved in emotional processing.
- Hippocampus: key [[memory]] center
- Amygdala: primary emotional center (fear)
- Hypothalamus: controls hormones 
- Basal ganglia: responsible for voluntary motor control, action selection, reward-based learning

The **Circle of Willis** is a ring-shaped vascular network at the base of the brain connecting seven main arteries. Its primary function is to redistribute blood flow between the anterior and posterior circulations if one vessel becomes blocked or narrowed (stenosis), preventing stroke.
### evolution
The human brain has evolved far beyond other primates to enable advanced cognitive processing:
- The prefrontal cortex has evolved to be much larger
- We have more neurons (and possible more white matter relative to brain size) than other primates

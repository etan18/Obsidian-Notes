Peception relies on priors and heuristics to process ambiguous information. We would choose the interpretation that is most likely. 

**Psychophysics** is a field of study which relates physical stimulus with psyhological phenomena. It is an objective approach to the study of perception.

## illusions
Illusions are the exceptions, not the rule, for the complex perceptive systems in our brain. Studying illusions provides us with the boundaries and heuristics of perception.
- **Vection**: processing motion around you makes you think you are moving when you aren't. 
- **Troxler fading**: when there's no change in stimulation, sometimes our brain stops responding (adaptation). We only process change.

## object identification
Hubel and Weisel's [[visual cortex|discoveries]] may have laid the foundation for the modern study of perception, but they also don't entirely hold up on their own today. Namely, they suggest that the shapes we perceive are a piecewise set of adjacent, eclosing barsâ€”a simple and easy-to-understand model, but also not the case, because it implies that we perceive the features of an object independently from one another.

In reality, a simple shape is a *superposition* of its components. **Spatial patterns** are perceived by summing small patches of sine waves with different frequencies and amplitudes. We call these patches **wavelets**.
#### surfaces
Surfaces are an intermediate level of analysis, where we are performing some basic grouping of particles. This is the first step into identifying objects.

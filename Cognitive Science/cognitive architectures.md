Proposed models for how we think, particularly in terms of how we organize and process information.

### **computational representational understanding of the mind (CRUM)**
Thinking is performed when computational procedures operate on representational structures.
-   Representational structures include
    -   Concepts — _schemas_
    -   Rules — _procedural knowledge_
    -   Analogies — _reasoning & decision making_
    -   Propositions — _declarative knowledge_
    -   Imagery — _visual representations_

### marr’s tri-level hypothesis, 1998
Informational Processing Units are defined by
1.  Computational Theory - _what it wants to solve_
2.  Algorithmic Theory - _how it solves_
    1.  **Software**
3.  Implementational Theory - _the physical components it’s comprised of_
    1.  **Hardware (the brain)**

### act-r
Rule-based architecture created by John Anderson
-   Knowledge is _procedural_ or _declarative_
    -   Procedural Memory = Productions
    -   Declarative Memory = Propositions
Working memory, or perceptions, are categorized into a knowledge form.

## prototypes & categorization
Categories exist in three levels: superordinate, basic level, and subordinate. Members of the basic level can be quickly identified by one overall shape and mental image.

### neural correlates of category specific knowledge
Research conducted by Martin Hagan et al.
-   16 healthy individuals were asked to identify objects in line drawings (animals or tools)
    -   Animals activated left occipital lobe, suggesting that participants looked more at visual attributes and features of the animal to identify it
    -   Tools activated the prefrontal area (motor cortex), suggesting that participants were considering the tool’s function
-   Concluded that there is a distinct neural activation pattern in recognizing different categories of things
    -   **Supports a distributed neural network model of semantic representations, rather than a localized (e.g. Grandmother cells) one**

### approaches to categorization
**Exemplar**
Categories are comprised of all instances of that category that you’ve encountered in the past.

**Feature**
Categories are defined by the features that are both necessary and sufficient for membership.

**Prototype**
Categories are defined by their most central member, or a representation of the average of all features.

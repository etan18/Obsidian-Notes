Peception relies on priors and heuristics to process ambiguous information. We would choose the interpretation that is most likely. 

**Psychophysics** is a field of study which relates physical stimulus with psyhological phenomena. It is an objective approach to the study of perception.

## illusions
Illusions are the exceptions, not the rule, for the complex perceptive systems in our brain. Studying illusions provides us with the boundaries and heuristics of perception.
- **Vection**: processing motion around you makes you think you are moving when you aren't. 
- **Troxler fading**: when there's no change in stimulation, sometimes our brain stops responding (adaptation). We only process change.

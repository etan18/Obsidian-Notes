#### greenhouse gases
Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are a class of gases in the atmosphere that trap heat by absorbing energy that reflects off the Earth's surface, typically from the sun. Major GHGs include
- Carbon dioxide (CO2) - 79% of Earth's GHG
- Methane (CH4)
- Nitrous Oxide (N2O)
- Water Vapor
The **greenhouse effect** is the process of trapping heat from the sun that has allowed Earth to sustain life for millions of years. However, increased GHG levels from human development has caused too much heat to be trapped in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.
##### carbon
**Fossil fuels**, such as coal, petroleum (oil), and natural gas, are non-renewable energy sources and the primary contributor to excess CO2 in the atmosphere. This is because, in order to produce energy, these fuels need to be burned in the presence of oxygen. This process, called **combustion**, produces CO2 as a byproduct that is released into the atmosphere.

### renewable energy
Three key levers—electric vehicles, heat pumps, and renewables—can cut down reliance on fossil fuels.

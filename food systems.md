### supply chain
In general, a **supply chain** can be broadly conceptualized as the interaction between various entities which are involved in the flow of products and services to their end customers.

The food supply chain is unique and consists of many stages:
1. **Farm**: the actual grower of crops, produce, livestock, etc.
	- For local farms, farmers markets may make up some portion of the farm's revenue stream. While it is expensive to attend a farmer's market (transportation, labor, licensing), farmers are also able to keep 100% of revenue by selling direct-to-consumer, instead of losing a cut to distribution centers.
2. **Producer**: only a small percentage of crops are sold as fresh produce---the rest is used to make all the other goods you may find at a grocery store, including sauces, prepackaged foods, powders, dried goods, etc.
3. **Distribution center**: act as a middleman connecting producers with buyers. 
	- Food hub: specialized distribution focusing on locally sourced foods. Provide "market access" to smaller farmers/producers.
4. **Wholesaler**: e.g. restaurants or grocery stores that buy goods in mass quantities
5. **Consumer**
These interconnected parts are heavily reliant on one another. Smaller farms may only have a few buyers act as a large portion of their revenue stream, or vice versa.

Food supply chains face unique challenges that question the applicability of general supply chain strategies. For example, 
- **Safety stock**: holding additional goods to meet demand fluctuations is not easily transferable to food supply chains due to the challenge of product deterioration, perishability, and waste.

Packaging is a big issue in the food supply chain, both in terms of cost and waste.

### the case for local

**Local and regional food systems are more resilient to changes.** 
For example, during COVID, many large supermarkets experienced shortages, but local farms were still able to produce at healthy capacities. Additionally, during recent avian flu outbreaks which saw shortages in eggs, many local suppliers were still able to supply at normal amounts.

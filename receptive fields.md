## simple cells
For vision, the receptive field is the area of the retina, corresponding to an area of the visual field, to which a cell is receptive. The [[neurons]] in the eyeball with receptive fields are **ganglion cells**, which eare each connected to [[visual cortex|photoreceptors]]. 
- The receptive field of a ganglion cell is entirely dependent on the type of photoreceptors which it is connected to, as well as how many they're connected to

>In order to observe activity, there must be contrast of light in our receptive field.

The receptive field for touch is the area of skin to which a neuron is receptive. 

## complex cells
Complex cells receive information from multiple simple cells. Thus, their receptive field stacks the receptive fields of all of its simple cells.
- This allows them to detect orientation and motion

## hypercomplex cells
Hypercomplex, or *endstopped*, cells receive information from multiple complex cells. Hypercomplex cells not only detect orientation, but now also factor in *length*.

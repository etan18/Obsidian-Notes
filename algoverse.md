**I. Introduction**
- What is video question answering (VQA)? https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.11543
	- Why is it important (relevance to robotics/VLA and that growing field of research)
	- What are its use cases/implementations
	- What makes VQA a challenging task
- Relationship between VQA and "agentic AI"
- What are reasoning LLMs? 
	- Why are they important? 
	- What are they used for that's different from a traditional LLM?
- Introduce our work
	- Explicitly state our **contributions**
		1. We perform an exploratory study of different uses of reasoning LLMs across different stages of a traditional EQA pipeline

**II. Experiments**

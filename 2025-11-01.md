Discuss the application of Sustainable manufacturing **and** supply chains to an industry you wish to work in or are generally interested in. In your response, refer to a specific part (paraphrased) of at least one of the readings to back your points—minimum 150 words.

One industry I am generally interested in is food. In the food industry, the future of sustainable supply chains comes through localizing or regionalizing food chains. This solution does not fully align with Walmart's Project Gigaton, because Walmart is a global chain with huge, multi-national suppliers. Their solutions would not, in my opinion, translate to the food industry. Sustainability in food supply chains comes from shortening supply chains to minimize transportation and encourage freshness to the end consumer.

For sustainable manufacturing, I think one exciting opportunity for innovation comes from food loss and waste solutions. Machado et al. (2020) specifically discuss the "reduction of waste, energy consumption, and overproduction" as one of the major sustainability benefits of Industry 4.0. Applying this to food systems, using the fourth industrial revolution to create “closed-loop production systems connecting machines, information systems, products and people in a network” directly translates to closed-loop farming methods (e.g. regenerative farming practices) or other methods of utilizing food loss and waste in ways that go back to the environment. Some examples include using food scraps for beauty care products, which is already being done. Additionally, creating channels to get food waste from regions of food security and food over-production to "food deserts" or food-insecure people is an open problem which I think can be solved via sustainable supply chains and manufacturing.

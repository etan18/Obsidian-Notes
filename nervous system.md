The nervous system is comprised of two types of cells: [[neurons]] and [[neurons#glial cells|glial cells]]. There are an estimated 100B neurons in the nervous system, and a similar number of glial cells.

The nervous system uses electrochemical stimulation for communication.
- The [[neurons#action potential|action potential]] is a chemical process of transmission for synaptic action
- 

The **central nervous system** (CNS) consists of the brain and spinal cord and is the body's primary control center for information processing and planning.


**Neuroplasticity** is the ability of the nervous system to reorganize its structure to reorganize its structure, functions, and connections in response to stimuli, such as [[learning]] or injury. 
- Synaptic plasticity: shaping of dendritic arbor (pruning, adding), thickening of myelin, expansion of astrocyte coverage in response to high/low rates of firing

>[!info] Dendritic Pruning
>The dendritic branches of a neuron change throughout its lifecycle. New arms may be added, while more commonly, branches may be deleted/pruned, with remaining branches becoming visibly thicker as the organism matures. This may be an [[representation learning|efficient coding]] strategy learned from patterns of firing.

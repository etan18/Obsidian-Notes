Defensive forecasting is a technique that uses a model's past mistakes to make new predictions. It was first introduced as a game-theoretic approach to prediction, framing the problem as a sequential game where you make a new prediction at every turn.

Processing these data inputs sequentially and making updates to the model based on these inputs is known as **online learning**.

One common strategy for improving the performance of a single model is to *ensemble* it with additional models. This means combining the outputs of multiple models, known as **base learners**, to improve our confidence in predictions.

Common ensemble learning methods:
- [[boosting]]
- [[bagging]]
- [[random forests]]

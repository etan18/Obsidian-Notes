> [!idea] Projection onto a subspace
> Given a subspace composed of orthonormal vectors $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k$, the projection of vector $x$ onto the subspace is $\tilde{x} = \sum_{i=1}^k (x \cdot v_i) v_i$.

The motivation for dimensionality reduction is to
- make computations cheaper
- remove irrelevant features
- find the basis for representing complex things

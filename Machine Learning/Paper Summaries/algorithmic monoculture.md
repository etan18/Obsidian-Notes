>[!info] Picking on the Same Person: Does Algorithmic Monoculture lead to Outcome Homogenization?
>Published in NeurIPS 2022 by Bommasani et al. from Stanford University.

**Algorithmic monoculture** is an observed societal phenomenon in which the same systems or algorithms are used by multiple decision-makers. 

There are significant risks to societal welfare caused by monoculture:
- **Outcome homogenization**: particular individuals or groups will repeatedly experience the same outcome across different deployments, leading to *systematic exclusion*. 
	- In the context of job hiring, if all firms in an industry use the same screening algorithm, the same candidates will always be accepted and rejected.

To this end, the authors also propose the **component sharing hypothesis**, which states that if algorithmic systems are increasingly built using the same models or trained on the same data, then they will increasingly homogenize outcomes.

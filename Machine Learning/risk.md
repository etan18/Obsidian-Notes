In statistical [[learning theory]], **risk** is the generalization error, usually notated as
$$R(h)$$
Mathematically, we can explain risk as being the expected value of our loss. 

It is different from simply being the *test error*, because our test error is limited to a specific, finite sample of data. For this reason, the test error is the same as *empirical risk*. Instead, risk embodies what we would expect the test error to be given an infinite sample of data.

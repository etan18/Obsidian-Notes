## photography & phonography

The main differences we see between these authors in their views on these information technologies is their viewpoint on
- What a photograph/phonograph can be
- What a photograph/phonograph should be

**Edison**
- Ties back to lecture, is the inventor of the technology the most reliable source to ask about its efficacy?


**Baudelaire**
- Involved in arts & literature, was a poet and translator
	- Fascinated by Edgar Allan Poe (American), and translated a few of his works into French (photos: The Raven, Extraordinary Stories of Edgar Allan Poe)
	- Poe wrote an article after the daguerrotype (the first publicly available process of capturing photos) calling it "perhaps the most extraordinary triumph of modern science"
- Art criticique came about in Europe during Baudelaire's time, he was a critic himself

(END BACKGROUND, GET INTO THE READING)

- Critiquing the manipulation of photographs
- Similar to Poe, Baudelaire also believed that the invention of photography was a great scientific feat

**Steichen**
- Steichen is one of the founders of photography as an art form, and most influential figures in the history of photography
	- Served as chief photographer/editor of both Vogue and Vanity Fair magazines in the 1920s and 30s (see: photos)
- This obviously biases his viewpoint, and this reading is essentially his rebuttal to people who criticize "prints" as an art form 
	- Essentially "images" that the professor talked about in lecture

(END BACKGROUND)

- The Vogue cover is an example of an "image" or "print"


## telegraph

This set of readings are a pair of articles both published in the North American Review in 1883, when the telegraph is becoming increasingly impactful for the dissemination of information.

These readings are essentially going against each other, which each of the authors taking a different side in the debate on whether or not the government should assume control of the telegraph system.
- Debate is extremely relevant today

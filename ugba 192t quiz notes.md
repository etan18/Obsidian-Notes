#### beyond burger 3.0 life cycle assessment
Scope
- "Cradle-to-distribution": LCAs for food products are usually farm to farm gate, basically what the producer can control 
	- Specifically, does not include transportation or food loss and waste (FLW) that occurs after manufacturing.
	- Explicitly excludes packaging end-of-life impacts - negligible difference between compared products
- Product: 1/4 lb. Beyond Burger packaged as two patties in a sealed PET (polyethylene terephthalate) tray
	- Functional unit: one 1/4 lb. uncooked patty delivered to retail distribution outlets
- Compared against a 1/4 lb. patty of US-produced beef, based on benchmark

Inputs
- Electricity (Table 4)
	- Coal
	- natural gas
	- hydroelectric, wind
	- nuclear, biomass, geothermal....
- Ingredients (Table 5)
- Packaging materials (Table 6)
- Cold storage energy demand

Impacts by indicator
- global warming (measured by CO2e)
- fossil resource scarcity
- land use
- water consumption (liters)

Results
- Consider the assessment results: health and environmental 
	- Environmental
		- Ingredient provision is an important contributor across all impact indicators, but primarily land use and water consumption (farming plants vs. raising livestock)
		- Non-fossil methane from enteric fermentation as well as manure management contributes more than 40% to the beef global warming impact, and nitrous oxide, primarily from field-level emissions during cultivation of feed crops, contributes more than 30%
- Consider the biggest differences between a beef and a Beyond Beef patty. (No, you do not need to memorize all the data.) Fundamentally, why do the differences occur

#### minh tsai & soybeans
- Soybeans are not typically grown in through monocropping operations --- they are particularly beneficial for crop rotations because they enrich the soil through nitrogen fixation, a natural fertilizer 
- High protein yield per acre of land used
- Soybean prices are volatile as they fluctuate with commodity markets

#### cream co & better meat
- What is better meat as defined by Cream Co?  
	- **From natural, sustainable, and regenerative farming practices**

- As defined by the World Research Institute? What is WRI’s argument? 
	- **Less meat**
	- **There is no single way to produce meat and dairy that’s “better” for all environmental, social, ethical and economic considerations.**
- If you were a supply chain manager considering standards for the meat you buy, what would the relative trade-offs be between “conventional” and other types of beef?
	- **Cost**
	- **Environmental vs. animal welfare**

#### retail sales
- What are the major values being expressed by supermarkets that we surveyed? 
	- **Convenience, abundance, freshness**
	- **Affordability (reinforced by private label offerings)**

- Which values are they taking credit for but are actually mandated by law or regulation? 
	- **Preventing food waste/donating scraps**: SB 1383
	- **Transparency**: COOL Law
- How do retail buyers choose the products they do for store shelves? 
- Consider specific ways buyers at one company can effect change that other buyers don’t. Consider any example from Bi-Rite or Berkeley Bowl or Trader Joes.

- What is the role within supermarkets who oversee what is purchased? **Buyers or procurement managers**
- How might a small producer of “better” snacks get considered by a supermarket? **Going through a distributor used by the supermarket**

Scope
- "Cradle-to-distribution": LCAs for food products are usually farm to farm gate, basically what the producer can control 
	- Specifically, does not include transportation or food loss and waste (FLW) that occurs after manufacturing.
	- Explicitly excludes packaging end-of-life impacts - negligible difference between compared products
- Product: 1/4 lb. Beyond Burger packaged as two patties in a sealed PET (polyethylene terephthalate) tray
	- Functional unit: one 1/4 lb. uncooked patty delivered to retail distribution outlets
- Compared against a 1/4 lb. patty of US-produced beef, based on benchmark

Inputs
- Electricity (Table 4)
	- Coal
	- natural gas
	- hydroelectric, wind
	- nuclear, biomass, geothermal....
- Ingredients (Table 5)
- Packaging materials (Table 6)
- Cold storage energy demand

Impacts by indicator
- global warming (measured by CO2e)
- fossil resource scarcity
- land use
- water consumption (liters)

Results
- Consider the assessment results: health and environmental 
	- Environmental
		- Ingredient provision is an important contributor across all impact indicators, but primarily land use and water consumption (farming plants vs. raising livestock)
		- Non-fossil methane from enteric fermentation as well as manure management contributes more than 40% to the beef global warming impact, and nitrous oxide, primarily from field-level emissions during cultivation of feed crops, contributes more than 30%
- Consider the biggest differences between a beef and a Beyond Beef patty. (No, you do not need to memorize all the data.) Fundamentally, why do the differences occur

#### minh tsai & soybeans
- Soybeans are not typically grown in through monocropping operations --- they are particularly beneficial for crop rotations because they enrich the soil through nitrogen fixation, a natural fertilizer 
- High protein yield per acre of land used
- Soybean prices are volatile as they fluctuate with commodity markets

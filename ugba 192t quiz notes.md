#### beyond burger 3.0 life cycle assessment
Scope
- "Cradle-to-distribution": LCAs for food products are usually farm to farm gate, basically what the producer can control 
	- Specifically, does not include transportation or food loss and waste (FLW) that occurs after manufacturing.
	- Explicitly excludes packaging end-of-life impacts - negligible difference between compared products
- Product: 1/4 lb. Beyond Burger packaged as two patties in a sealed PET (polyethylene terephthalate) tray
	- Functional unit: one 1/4 lb. uncooked patty delivered to retail distribution outlets
- Compared against a 1/4 lb. patty of US-produced beef, based on benchmark

Inputs
- Electricity (Table 4)
	- Coal
	- natural gas
	- hydroelectric, wind
	- nuclear, biomass, geothermal....
- Ingredients (Table 5)
- Packaging materials (Table 6)
- Cold storage energy demand

Impacts by indicator
- global warming (measured by CO2e)
- fossil resource scarcity
- land use
- water consumption (liters)

Results
- Consider the assessment results: health and environmental 
	- Environmental
		- Ingredient provision is an important contributor across all impact indicators, but primarily land use and water consumption (farming plants vs. raising livestock)
		- Non-fossil methane from enteric fermentation as well as manure management contributes more than 40% to the beef global warming impact, and nitrous oxide, primarily from field-level emissions during cultivation of feed crops, contributes more than 30%
- Consider the biggest differences between a beef and a Beyond Beef patty. (No, you do not need to memorize all the data.) Fundamentally, why do the differences occur

#### minh tsai & soybeans
- Soybeans are not typically grown in through monocropping operations --- they are particularly beneficial for crop rotations because they enrich the soil through nitrogen fixation, a natural fertilizer 
- High protein yield per acre of land used
- Soybean prices are volatile as they fluctuate with commodity markets

#### cream co & better meat
- What is better meat as defined by Cream Co?  
	- **From natural, sustainable, and regenerative farming practices**
	- **Decentralized micro-regional supply chains, family owned farms**
	- **100% hormone and antibiotic free, "natural-or-better" USDA butchery**
- As defined by the World Research Institute? What is WRI’s argument? 
	- **Less meat**
	- **There is no single way to produce meat and dairy that’s “better” for all environmental, social, ethical and economic considerations.**
- If you were a supply chain manager considering standards for the meat you buy, what would the relative trade-offs be between “conventional” and other types of beef?
	- **Cost**
	- **Environmental vs. animal welfare**

#### retail sales
- What are the major values being expressed by supermarkets that we surveyed? 
	- **Convenience, abundance, freshness**
	- **Affordability (reinforced by private label offerings)**
	- **Berkeley Bowl et al.: Sustainable, local, responsible** 
- Which values are they taking credit for but are actually mandated by law or regulation? 
	- **Preventing food waste/donating scraps**: SB 1383
	- **Transparency**: COOL Law
- How do retail buyers choose the products they do for store shelves? 
- Consider specific ways buyers at one company can effect change that other buyers don’t. Consider any example from Bi-Rite or Berkeley Bowl or Trader Joes.

- What is the role within supermarkets who oversee what is purchased? **Buyers or procurement managers**
- How might a small producer of “better” snacks get considered by a supermarket? **Going through a distributor used by the supermarket**
- What is the typical margin that a supermarket adds to products they buy? **40%**

#### food loss & waste
- Where does food waste occur in supply chains? 
- What are some steps that supply chain managers can take to reduce food loss and waste in different types of organizations?

#### distribution
- Food is moved from farm gate to warehouse to retail locations. Most food is also distributed to processing facilities before being moved to warehouses or distribution centers. 
- What is the role of 3PLs, redistributors, broadline and specialty distributors? 
- Who (what kinds of institutions) would use one kind or another type of distributor? 
- What are their relative advantages and disadvantages?

#### sustainable financing
- No one can reasonably argue that innovation isn’t needed to make our food supply chains more efficient, environmentally responsible, or better able to serve hungry people, though we don’t always agree on what innovations we want - or are willing to pay for. 
- Review the Rachel Stinebaugh transcript. 
	- What are some challenges that venture capitalists (who are called on to provide larger sums of money at one time than, say, consumers at the end of the supply chain) see as impeding innovation? 
		- **Enterprise software adoption has been slow.** Many operators hesitated to adopt software that required manual data entry; even with AI, many startups look undifferentiated (“doing what OpenAI/Claude allow”), making it hard to pick winners.
	- According to Stinebaugh (and her view is widely shared), What are some characteristics that make supply chain innovators more “investable” than other applicants? By investable, we mean more likely to be financially successful at scaling innovations, using a successful business model, that creates something “better” we can include in future supply chains?
		- Minimal disruption to existing workflows
		- Founder-market fit in food/supply chains

##### extended producer responsibility
- How might it apply to food supply chains and food supply chain decision-making?

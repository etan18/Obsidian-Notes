**Reaction to clean energy readings**
From the Vox article, my biggest takeaway is that the maximum feasible transition, at this point, will require "an aggressive WWII-style ramp-up" and "an intensive deployment of decarbonized infrastructure and technology". The US power grid currently cannot sustain the necessary energy demand for such a transition, but I also wonder if scaling up energy will produce offshoot environmental ramifications. The article justifies this by saying a clean energy transition will drive energy demand down 50%, which makes sense.

Something that stood out to me was the irony of China leading the clean energy race, as well as some of the circumstances that led up to it. From the article, China's transition is made possible by a combination of factors, including "investing heavily in the hazardous process of chemically refining these materials". This is addressed later on in the article to clarify that the "commonly held view that China only used subsidies, intellectual property theft and low-cost labor to achieve an advantage in clean energy seriously underestimates the technological capabilities of China today".

One question I am left with is: China demonstrates that major clean energy transitions require drastic measures and, at times, unsustainable and inhumane practices to scale fast---is it possible for the US clean energy transition to avoid these same pitfalls?
